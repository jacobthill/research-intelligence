Rhoads and Don Wuebbles<br/>Abstract<br/>Hydrologic science has evolved to embrace scientists from a diverse range of disciplines, driven by the many challenging problems that now exist at the interface of various science disciplines,. Tremendous strides have been made but the enormous complexity of the problems continues to pose challenges for predicting interactions among the physical, biological, biogeochemical, and human subsystems that shape the behavior of hydrologic systems, especially in the context of human-induced changes to climate and land use. Predictions focused on individual components or unchanging landscapes or climate are no longer deemed satisfactory. The changing environment therefore provides both a challenge and an opportunity for developing sound foundations for improving the predictability of water cycle dynamics through an approach based on a synthesis of observations, analysis methods, concepts and theories across a broad range of scientific fields, including hydrology, ecology, geomorphology, geochemistry, and the social sciences, in a manner sufficient to meet the water challenges we now face and will face in the future. The aim of this project is to conduct a range of synthesis activities that will produce transformational outcomes in the critical research area of ""improving predictability of water cycle dynamics in a changing environment,"" which will serve as an effective model of synthesis within the hydrological community. This objective will be achieved by through the formation of a targeted synthesis team and associated synthesis activity groups, and through these groups, carrying out focused research activities to generate outcomes that will serve as national prototypes of the power of synthesis for investigating and solving complex hydrologic problems. The synthesis activities will consist of a mix of workshops, small-group research activities, combined with the use of cyber-infrastructure. To undertake this project, a research consortium has been formed consisting of several established research centers as partners (NCED, HWR/SAHRA, NCAR, NCEAS, IRI, NCSA) with UIUC acting as the hub. Membership of the synthesis team and synthesis activity groups will be open to partner organizations as well as the general scientific community.<br/><br/>"

This will be an addition to the Critical Zone Observatories (CZO) that are being initiated at various locations in North America.  The Luquillo CZO will use the natural laboratory of the Luquillo Mountains to quantify and contrast how critical zone processes in watersheds underlain by granodiorite  and volcaniclastic bedrock are affected by climatic conditions and hydrologic, geochemical and biogeochemical cycles.  A set of interrelated hypothesis, sampling sites, and a unified data management system will allow critical zone processes to be contrasted by bedrock, landscape position (ridge, hillslope, riparian), depth (surface to bedrock), forest type (Tabonuco, Colorado, Cloud) and location (upland to coastal).  <br/> <br/>Changing climate affects many processes, and the breakdown of rocks into soil; is one of the most important. In addition, there may be changes in water flow in rivers, as well as erosion of surficial materials. Sediment is already the nation's largest water quality pollutant and modern land uses are eroding soils and sculpting bedrock in unprecedented ways. The Luquillo Critical Zone Observatory will provide the infrastructure and baseline studies needed to evaluate short and long-term impacts of this erosion on soil and water resources. The Observatory will also support integrated, multi-institutional and multicultural exchanges among a diverse cadre of scientists, who will collaborate to determine the effects of climate change on the terrestrial environment."

The observatory is designed as a natural laboratory for the earth science community to test hypotheses related to CZ function in relation to climate and water cycle variation. We posit that CZ systems organize and evolve in response to open system fluxes of energy and mass that can be quantified from point to watershed scales. These fluxes include meteoric CZ inputs of radiation, water, and carbon that are modulated by surficial biota to produce fluids and biogeochemical components that undergo biotic and abiotic transformation during gradient-driven transport. We hypothesize that the coupling of physical, chemical and biological processes is related predictably to the timing and magnitude of these fluxes. Therefore, our CZ Observatory (CZO) is designed to examine the impacts of space-time variability in energy and water flux on coupled processes along two well-constrained climate gradients. The first is on rhyolitic parent material in the Jemez River Basin of northern New Mexico (JRB) and the second is on granite and schist bedrock within the Santa Catalina Mountains in southern Arizona (SCM). Measurement, modeling, and experimentation at sites that vary in parent rock, elevation, aspect, slope, soil development, and vegetation will enable quantification of the feedbacks between energy and mass fluxes (driven by chemical and physical gradients) and measured components of CZ structure. Our team has developed an iterative modeling and measurement strategy, and a management structure that fosters integration among disciplines. <br/>The JRB-SCM CZO is organized around broad questions that require an integrated, multi-disciplinary approach.  These questions include:  How does variability in energy input and related mass flux influence CZ structure and function?  How do feedbacks between landscape evolution and the cycling of water and carbon alter short- and long-term CZ development?  To identify the couplings among physical, chemical, and biological processes, our research integrates three cross-cutting science themes that are multi-disciplinary and multi-scale: Ecohydrology and Hydrologic Partitioning, Subsurface Biogeochemistry, and Landscape Evolution. We are employing an integrated, process-based modeling approach to (i) identify optimal sites for measuring structure and process, (ii) refine hypotheses developed through field-based observation and measurements, (iii) explore feedbacks and emergent system behaviors, and (iv) develop transfer functions that can be used to relate system behavior across scales and modes of observation. <br/>Discoveries made at the JRB-SCM CZO will improve our ability to predict CZ response to changes in climate and land cover. Such information is immediately useful to regional resource managers and will ultimately inform broader-scale decision making. We will coordinate closely with other CZOs to support data collection, storage, and dissemination of results. Our education and outreach activities are built upon highly effective educational efforts conceived and cultivated at UA, and they are linked to related efforts of science centers active in the region. We are developing a range of products and activities for K?16 students, the general public, and stakeholders, including summer Observatory field experiences for local high school and undergraduate students, graduate courses, and field camps in earth science. We invite new investigators throughout the global earth sciences community to conduct novel and collaborative research at the JRB-SCM CZO."

The Earth's critical zone lies between the top of the vegetation and unweathered rock (NRC, 2001); it is in essence our living environment.  Design and instrumentation of the BcCZO is driven by a suite of Earth science investigations to understand the transformation of rock into soil, and to quantify how the relevant processes are modulated by and coupled to both external forcings (e.g. climate) and intrinsic properties of the critical zone.  The BcCZO extends from the continental divide to the range front, encompassing slightly more than 1000 km2 (~400 square miles) and a range of 2600 m (~8500 ft) in altitude.  The relatively large drop in elevation within a single watershed provides an important contrast in climate and ecological regimes, which in turn provides a critical contrast in erosional processes.  As a consequence, the properties and structure of the critical zone vary across the watershed, constituting a natural experiment on critical zone evolution and function.  <br/><br/>Three subcatchments of the BcCZO representing different states of critical zone development will be densely monitored via a networked infrastructure of geophysical, geochemical, and hydrological instrumentation.  Intrinsic properties of the rock-soil column, including microbial biomass and activity, will be measured at multiple localities. The BcCZO will also leverage extant data and instrumentation from partners in the same and neighboring watersheds (e.g., NSF's Long-term Ecological Research (LTER) site, Niwot Ridge), including the unparalleled 50-year Mountain Climate Program.  These data, coupled with high-resolution digital topography, cosmogenic nuclide analyses, and numerical hydrochemical models will allow development of the first mechanistic and quantitative description of processes that generate the critical zone.  Simulations will be developed to explore the effect of critical zone properties on hydrologic and biogeochemical fluxes.  <br/><br/>The BcCZO will exploit intersections with the Niwot Ridge LTER site (which is the National Ecological Observatory Network Core Site, and with the Community Surface Dynamic Modeling System.  The observatory will position itself as a resource to the broader scientific community through competitive graduate field fellowships, open science meetings, and maintenance of accessible data and sample archives.  Results will be disseminated widely in journal publications, presentations at scientific meetings, and through web pages. <br/><br/>The observatory will support the community-based BASIN.org environmental information network, viewed by more than 150,000 unique visitors per year.  Through partnership with Science Discovery at UC Boulder, K-12 classroom, field programs, and curriculum will be developed for elementary-middle schoolers.  A graduate level course using BcCZO field sites, and a field trip offered during the Geological Society of America annual meeting will extend the impact of the BcCZO within the scientific community."

Over the long term, the rates of weathering and erosion combine to control the evolution of landscapes and help to define the access, rates of motion, and time scales of water and energy within the Critical Zone (CZ). Despite the importance of these processes, we are generally unable to quantitatively predict the rates or mechanisms by which regolith forms or how it controls water flow. Understanding these rates is of particular importance due to the rapid rates of change of the CZ in response to anthropogenic and climate perturbation. Here we propose a Critical Zone Observatory dedicated to developing this understanding for one of the most common lithologies on earth. <br/>Our Critical Zone Observatory site, the focus of National Science Foundation-supported research since the 1970s, provides long term datasets for hydrological response that will be augmented here by new geochemical, geomorphological, ecological, and soils datasets. The observatory is a small catchment in central Pennsylvania (hereafter termed the Susquehanna/Shale Hills Observatory or SSHO) on Rose Hill Shale. As a tectonically quiescent and relatively pristine watershed, Shale Hills presents the opportunity to investigate the rates and mechanisms of regolith formation on a simple but ubiquitous bedrock lithology. The regolith at the SSHO has experienced at least two potentially significant perturbations in the geologically recent past: a climatic perturbation from peri-glacial to modern conditions and a biologic perturbation from anthropogenic clearing of forests during colonial occupation. The magnitude of these perturbations and their influence on regolith generation afford an opportunity to assess the time scales of response of soil production to both long-term climate change and human activity. <br/>Broader Impacts: To predict the creation, evolution, and structure of regolith as a function of the geochemical, hydrologic, biologic, and geomorphologic processes in our forested landscape, we have created an interdisciplinary team of 14 scientists from 8 universities, 1 federal agency, and 2 national laboratories. This team will coordinate not only the SSHO but also six satellite sites where we will initiate similar but less extensive investigations to explore the effect of climate and composition on shale weathering. Among these, Alabama A&M and University of Puerto Rico are minority-serving institutions that will facilitate the involvement of under-represented groups in Critical Zone science. Scientists and REU students from each satellite site (eighteen students over three years) will work closely with members of the Penn State team on a variety of activities ranging from geochemical analyses of soil and bedrock samples to measurement of soil moisture with onsite detectors. The observational data and model capabilities developed in the proposed effort will be made available through web-services for both time series data and geospatial data through the CZEN cyberinfrastructure initiative. Development of the SSHO on-line information system will be supported by ongoing NSF observatory and cyberinfrastructure grants. It is our vision that the SSHO will become an exemplar for Critical Zone observational and modeling science that will attract many additional investigators from the broader community to test ideas, techniques, and predictions. <br/><br/>"

While this zone has characteristically rapid seasonal changes, going from snowcover to wet soil to dry soil over a 1-2 month period, climate warming will shift this transition period earlier or eliminate it entirely.  The result will be major changes in seasonal-to-interannual critical zone processes involving water, nutrients and ecosystem response of the largely mixed conifer forest found in the rain-snow transition zone.  Steep gradients in precipitation patterns, along both elevation and aspect, plus rapid seasonal changes, make this zone an excellent natural laboratory for studying how critical zone processes respond to perturbations, and particularly how the water cycle drives critical zone processes.<br/><br/>The proposed Critical Zone Observatory (CZO) will take advantage of these features by establishing a snowline CZO as a community resource, providing both a platform for research by investigators from multiple disciplines and a vigorous research program aimed at yielding general knowledge and tools for understanding the interactions between water, atmosphere, ecosystems and landforms in the critical zone.  CZO data and knowledge will also enhance the science experience of thousands of middle and high school students, and multiple university students.  The CZO will be located in the Kings River Experimental Watershed (KREW), a watershed-level, integrated ecosystem project for long-term research in headwater catchments in the Sierra National Forest; it takes advantage of multiple well-instrumented and characterized catchments and long-term data sets at KREW (37.053oN, 119.194oW, 1,400-2,000 m elevation).  <br/><br/>A primary, overarching goal is to understand how critical zone processes control fluxes and stores of water across the landscape, and how the water cycle modulates (bio)geochemical, biological, geomorphological and pedological processes in the critical zone.

Process understanding of erosion, weathering, soil formation, water movement and nutrient transport in the critical zone depends in large part on new observations, coupled with models that can take advantage of those new data. In particular, accurate, high&#8208;resolution images of the land surface and vegetation canopy, and the structure in between, have the ability to transform our ability to describe and model those processes, and to predict how changes in climate and landcover will perturb water cycles and critical&#8208;zone processes linked to water. Airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) is proving to be a transformational technology that can determine the three&#8208;dimensional structure of the critical zone, and thus enable this process research. LiDAR flights will measure canopy during leaf on/leaf off conditions, snow distribution and other physical features of the land surface at the three NSF&#8208;supported Critical Zone Observatories (CZOs) and other three key sites. Physiographic data will be used to derive the LiDAR products, such as a high&#8208;resolution digital elevation model, tree heights, tree diameter at breast height, leaf area index, crown cover, and snow depth.

The data will enable examining the role of aspect in geomorphic and hydrologic behavior, and the feedbacks between slope, soil moisture, weathering, soil formation and vegetation. Hydrologic simulations using emerging, physics&#8208;based models will also be carried out, using the high&#8208;spatial&#8208;resolution topographic and canopy products from LiDAR. High&#8208;resolution estimates of spatial patterns of snow depth will provide an unprecedented ground&#8208;truth data set for modeling the physiographic controls on snow accumulation and melt. LiDAR scenes will contribute to estimating vegetation structure, which will then be used for parameter estimation in coupled hydro&#8208;ecologic model analysis and in scaling of evapotranspiration and carbon flux. LiDAR&#8208;based estimates of micro&#8208;topography, the patterns of which give rise to ?hot? and ?cold? spots of soil biogeochemical cycling generated by preferential flow of nutrient&#8208;rich litter leachate into mineral soils, will help guide sampling of litter and soil nutrient concentrations along gradients of water and biological availability. By quantifying functional controls on rates of erosion and weathering, the LIDAR data will contribute to improved understanding of how (and why) sediment and solutes move across (and through) the landscape. <br/><br/>Broader impacts: There are two main, direct broader impacts of this project. First, making LiDAR data available for the three CZOs will enhance their potential and use as community platforms for research. The goal of CZOs is to build a network to advance interdisciplinary studies of Earth surface processes as well as foster collaboration among scientists and engineers from different disciplines. However, existing spatial data cannot meet the research needs of the CZO teams because of being incomplete, outdated and of insufficient spatial resolution and temporal scale. A second broader impact will be to make LiDAR products easily understood and widely used by researchers working at CZOs and similar study areas, building on the community nature of CZO data and resources, and well&#8208;developed plans to share those resources and disseminate CZO products.<br/>"

During the last five years the PIs have shown that: (i) Mass dependent isotopic fractionation (MDF) occurred during the microbial reduction of ionic mercury (Hg[II]) by several bacterial strains that possess the enzyme mercuric reductase and MDF also occurred during microbial methylmercury (MeHg) degradation; (ii) Photoreduction of Hg(II) and photodegradation of MeHg caused MDF as well as mass independent fractionation (MIF) of up to 2?. Varying amounts of MIF (denoted as Ä199Hg and Ä201Hg) recorded in freshwater and marine fish tissue suggested different extents of photo degradation of MeHg prior to its incorporation into the aquatic food web. These results along with large variations in natural samples documented by the Blum lab and others, strongly suggest that the isotopic composition of Hg has the potential for distinguishing between different sources of Hg(0) emissions and pathways of Hg(II) reduction and MeHg degradation.<br/>To date, the PIs? studies have focused on Hg redox transformations and MeHg degradation. Yet, the bioaccumulation of MeHg in aquatic food webs has a profound effect on human and ecosystem health and the examination of whether or not isotope fractionation occurs during methylation of Hg is, therefore, a high priority. If significant fractionation occurs during formation of MeHg and is modulated by different environmental conditions and by the nature of the methylating processes, tools for distinguishing sources and pathways of MeHg in the environment may become available and enhance the management of Hg contaminated ecosystems. The first objective of the proposed study is the examination of isotopic fractionation during Hg methylation by sulfate and iron reducing bacteria to test the hypothesis that microbial Hg methylation results in significant MDF, but not in MIF. The second objective is the investigation of<br/>how environmental variables, which define freshwater and marine environments, impact MIF and MDF during Hg redox transformations to test the hypothesis that photochemical reduction, oxidation and demethylation will imprint diagnostic MDF and MIF signatures on reaction substrates and products. Finally, Hg isotopic fractionation during transformation pathways mediated by an important component of aquatic ecosystems, phototrophic planktonic organisms, has not been examined to date. The third objective addresses this lack of knowledge by testing the hypothesis that intracellular Hg(II) reduction and MeHg degradation in phytoplankton incubated in the light will result in MDF and possibly MIF. <br/><br/>Broader Impact: The proposed research activity will continue to lay the groundwork for a new approach or the identification of sources, sinks, and pathways of Hg transformations in impacted ecosystems. This approach has the potential to significantly enhance understanding of Hg biogeochemistry on temporal and spatial scales ranging from molecular mechanisms, to ecosystems, to global cycles, and to the geological record. As ecosystem Hg contamination remains a major public health concern, this project will support implementation of sound environmental practices to reduce Hg contamination and exposure. The proposed research will train a postdoctoral fellow in the application of stable isotope-based approaches in geobiology and ecosystem processes. In addition, undergraduate and graduate students will be integrated into the project, exposing them to cutting edge concepts and technologies, which are at the interface between biology, geology and ecosystem sciences. It is at this interface that important<br/>paradigm-shifting, research advances are being made. Undergraduate students will assist with the analytical geochemistry as part of senior thesis research projects and PhD dissertation projects. Results will be published and disseminated broadly."

While it is widely held that these events were driven by enhanced primary production within surface waters, the details underpinning the initiation, maintenance and termination of OAEs remain equivocal. This work will reveal the potential of sulfur (S) isotope studies to illuminate the role of changing sulfate concentrations on phosphate (PO4) regeneration in marine sediments and will have far-reaching implications for understanding the behavior of the C cycle, and therefore climate, especially in the deep time record. This is because marine sulfate levels have been low for much of Earth history. The objective of this proposal is to investigate the role sulfur plays in regulating the marine carbon cycle in low sulfate oceans. The following hypothesis will be tested: given an average background of low marine sulfate concentrations, an increase in seawater sulfate levels may trigger widespread oceanic anoxia by facilitating enhanced phosphorus (P) recycling and thus higher primary production within marine surface waters. Because seawater sulfate concentrations have been low for most of Earth?s history, substantial fluctuations in sulfate levels in the past may have played a key role in regulating C cycling in ancient oceans. In order to test this hypothesis, this proposal details a study with three fundamental themes, each of which will be integrated with an educational outreach effort developed through the Office of STEM Education Partnerships (OSEP) in the School of Education and Social Policy at Northwestern University. The themes include: (1) S isotope systematics and the link between fluctuating sulfate levels and P recycling in a low sulfate, permanently anoxic lake (Lake McCarrons, MN), (2) the S isotope composition of seawater sulfate, sedimentary pyrite and difference between the two phases (Ä34S) before, during and after two oceanic anoxic events?OAE1a in the Early Cretaceous and the Frasnian-Famennian event in the Late Devonian, and (3) reservoir dependent mass balance modeling using S isotopes. The results from this project will improve the community?s understanding of S and P cycling in low sulfate systems, establish Ä34Ssulfate-pyrite for two time periods marked by widespread anoxia (the Early Cretaceous and the Late Devonian), and help to ascertain the complex set of feedbacks that link ocean redox and the geochemical cycles of C, S, P, and Fe in the low sulfate oceans of Earth?s past.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This project will provide training to two graduate students in field research techniques and analytical isotope geochemistry and make contributions to understanding controls on biogeochemical cycles of C, S, P and Fe and their relationship to the redox state of the Earth system. Impacts of this project extend beyond the scientific community via an outreach effort to public high schools. The overall goal of the outreach effort is to bring the excitement and challenge of doing real science to high school students. This proposal requests funds to recruit a local high school science teacher to participate in research each summer. This teacher will collaborate to develop laboratory activities to provide high school students with research experiences through the NSF-funded iLab Network (ilabcentral.org), which allows students and educators to use remote experimental apparatus to carry out experiments via the Web. Once the iLab experiments have been tested, through development with the initial high school and then with OSEP partner schools in the area, they will be made available to any high school teacher with a web browser. To address the problem of underrepresented groups in Earth Science, a partnership has been initiated with Project EXCITE, a program that links Northwestern?s Center for Talent Development with local schools to identify scientifically inclined minority students and support their acquisition of math and science skills through high school. Saturday enrichment sessions with Project EXCITE students and their parents are ongoing, focusing on key Earth science concepts (earthquakes, tsunamis, climate change) and career options in Earth and Planetary Sciences. This proposal seeks funds to support high school students from EXCITE as lab assistants to increase awareness of opportunities in Earth science for local students and their families."
1023586,AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY OF GLACIER SLIP OVER HARD AND SOFT BEDS,EAR,"Geomorphology & Land-use Dynam, CZO-Critical Zone Obsrvatories",7/15/2010,8/16/2012,Neal Iverson,IA,Iowa State University,Continuing Grant,Richard Yuretich,6/30/2016,"$390,368.00 ",Denis Cohen-corticchiato,niverson@iastate.edu,1138 Pearson,AMES,IA,500112207,5152945225,GEO,"7458, 7693","0000, OTHR",$0.00 ,"Movement of glaciers and ice sheets affects their stability and attendant sea-level rise as the climate warms. In addition, ice-sheet movement during the Pleistocene left a spectacular imprint on landscapes. Glaciers that move fastest and modify landscapes most severely move primarily by slip over their rock (hard) or sediment (soft) beds. Increasingly sophisticated theories of this slip have been advanced over the last half-century, but these theories are largely untested, owing to the inaccessibility of glacier beds and the spatial and temporal variability of conditions there. The objective of this project is to use a newly constructed laboratory device to study relationships among glacier slip velocity, basal drag (slip resistance) and effective pressure (ice pressure minus water pressure at the bed). The device drags a ring of melting ice (0.9 m outside diameter, 0.2 m wide, 0.15 m thick) across a hard or soft bed. Features of the device include unlimited slip displacement, temperature control to a few hundredths of degree, and continuous observation of ice sliding and flow separation at the bed. One set of experiments will test the theory that as slip velocity increases, steady drag on a rough, hard bed attains a maximum value and then either remains constant or decreases, depending upon the bed geometry. Basal drag, slip velocity, and effective pressure will be individually varied during slip of ice at its melting temperature over stepped and sinusoidal bed surfaces. Numerical modeling of ice flow under the geometric constraints of the experiment will allow theoretical results to be compared directly with experimental data. A second set of experiments will provide relationships among slip velocity, drag, and effective pressure for soft beds. These experiments will also reveal both the extent to which ice invades the pore spaces of soft beds by melting and refreezing and the degree to which soft beds deform to accommodate slip?problems central to evaluating sediment transport by glaciers. <br/><br/>Robust quantitative models of glacier slip are needed to forecast the speeds of glaciers and ice sheets. Glaciers have been observed surging, i.e. moving forward at unusually high velocities, and retreating at various rates, apparently in response to changing climate. The experimental studies of this project will examine glacier movement in a a way that can not be determined from field observations.  A more complete analysis of the sliding process will allow glacier slip to be treated more accurately and less arbitrarily in computer models of glacier and ice-sheet motion. This will permit better characterizations of environmental change in the near future and of landscape evolution in the distant past."

The aim of this project is to elucidate how the mechanisms and kinetics of bacterial acquisition of Fe, Mo and V from soils may limit or control N2 fixation rates. N2-fixing bacteria produce siderophores (or ?iron carriers?) to bind iron in the external medium and take up the resulting Fe-siderophore complexes. Our recent work has shown that the siderophores are actually ?metallophores? used in the uptake of Mo and V, along with Fe. The biological acquisition of the various nitrogenase metal cofactors thus depends on their binding by bacterial metallophores. This project is organized around two major hypotheses: 1. Free-living N2-fixing bacteria excrete metallophores that are particularly efficient at capturing the metal (Mo, V or Fe) that is limiting N2 fixation; 2. Because of both competition with other metals for metallophore binding and scarcity in soils, Mo is inherently difficult to acquire and free-living N2-fixing bacteria often use alternative nitrogenases, particularly the V-nitrogenase, to fix N2. These hypotheses will be tested through a combination of laboratory and field experiments. Field studies will focus on sites where Mo may be limiting and employ molecular biological techniques to identify alternative nitrogenases.<br/><br/><br/>Broader Impacts: One postdoctoral researcher, one graduate student and several undergraduates will work on this project and be mentored by the PIs. Students from the local junior colleges will participate in the summer field research. The PIs will participate in the Quest summer program for school teachers."

A goal of the Continuously Operating Caribbean GPS Observational Network (COCONet) is to add 50 new semi-permanently monumented, continuously operating, Global Positioning Satellite (cGPS) stations spanning multiple Caribbean and Caribbean bordering nations. COCONet goals also call for the integration of GPS data from up to 50 existing stations operating in the Caribbean.  The new cGPS stations will, in some cases, be co-located with existing tide gauges, thus supporting studies of sea level change in response to current global warming, and will be mated with surface meteorological observational equipment (Metpacks) to significantly expand spatiotemporal geodetic and atmospheric observational infrastructure in a region of complex tectonics with substantial earthquake, tsunami, volcanic, tropical storm and hurricane, flooding and landslide hazards.  COCONet will provide a backbone fiducial and meteorologic observational network and COCONet data and data products that will be freely available through the UNAVCO archive will be available to serve a broad range of basic tectonic and atmospheric research investigations and enable observations of immediate relevance for advancing understanding, mitigating and perhaps predicting regional geohazards.  Some specific questions that COCONet data could help to address include:  1) How rigid is the Caribbean plate?; 2)  What are the slip rates along active faults that bound the Caribbean plate?; 3)  How is stress released at convergent plate boundaries and how is stress transferred across plate boundaries?; and 4)  How can we better understand and assess hazards in the Caribbean and Central American regions?  Atmospheric questions that could be advanced by proposed GPS meteorological determinations and surface measurements of atmospheric physical properties include: 1)  How sensitive is tropospheric water vapor content to changes in sea surface temperatures?; and  2) How does the distribution of precipitable water vapor across the Caribbean region influence the genesis, intensification and vectoring of tropical storms and hurricanes?    <br/><br/>COCONet data will flow via the EarthScope Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO) data management system and be available via the Web-accessible UNAVCO data archive.  Low-latency data telemetry will be via cellular modem or through VSAT satellite communications to the PBO Network Operations Center in Boulder, Colorado.  These data will be processed into derived geodetic products, including combined GPS station position and velocity estimates, simplified position time series and velocity field estimates in multiple formats, at the existing PBO GPS Analysis Centers at Central Washington University and New Mexico Tech and the Analysis Center Coordinator at MIT.  In addition, UCAR will estimate tropospheric precipitable water vapor (PV) every 30 minutes from observations of GPS radio frequency signal propagation delays along the path length between the satellite transmitter and the receiver coupled with concurrent surface measurement of barometric pressure.  The PV observations will feed into operational numerical weather models run several times per day.  <br/><br/>The project will engage Caribbean researchers, their students and governmental agency representatives with the goal of empowering these nations to utilize COCONet data for both scientific and socioeconomic purposes.  Real-time data from COCONet will be made available to the International GNSS Service (IGS) to help densify GPS observations in a region of the globe with few existing real-time data streams and thereby improve GPS satellite orbit calculations and help to refine the international terrestrial reference frame (ITRF)."

This earthquake triggered widespread landslides in the Min Jiang catchment area, and our preliminary data indicate that these landslides significantly changed the amount and composition of sediment carried by the river, and the chemistry of the river water. In our research, which seizes the opportunity presented by this rare natural experiment, we will collaborate with colleagues from the UK, Germany, and China to combine (i) compilation and interpretation of hydrometric data from the Chinese Hydrologic Bureau, (ii) fieldwork to collect representative samples, and (iii) new analyses targeted to explore key geochemical signatures in material carried by the river.

In particular, we will explore differences before and after the earthquake in (i) the amount of suspended sediment carried by the river; (ii) the 10Be concentration in riverbed sediments; (iii) the dissolved major element composition of river waters; and (iv) the concentration and flux of particulate organic carbon transported as part of river sediment. <br/>In rivers around the world, measurements of sediment concentrations, and of the chemical properties of sediment and river water, have been routinely used to understand some of the most important processes at the Earth?s surface such as 1) physical erosion and sediment mobilization that pose widespread engineering hazards and 2) mineral weathering and organic carbon transport that play central roles in the global carbon cycle. It is commonly assumed that measurements made at any one point in time on a river reflect what is going on over much longer periods of time. If very large disturbances that happen only very rarely ? such as an extreme earthquake ? have significant effects on these measured parameters, then our quantitative understanding of important processes like erosion, sediment mobilization, and the global carbon cycle may be incomplete. The 2008 Wenchuan earthquake in Sichuan, China, provides an ideal and rare opportunity to explore whether this is the case, because the large-magnitude earthquake had such a significant effect in triggering landslides in the headwaters of the Yangtze River, and because we can take advantage of extensive data that were collected on the Yangtze prior to the earthquake.

One climatic variation that has enormous influence of the effectiveness of erosion is temperature, as represented by the vast difference between erosion by rivers (i.e. fluvial erosion) and glaciers. A profound global acceleration in erosion several million years ago has been ascribed in countless studies to the onset of global cooling and the expansion of glaciers. This has lead to the idea that glaciers are absolutely efficient agents of erosion, acting like buzz saws that can erode rock as fast as plate tectonics pushes up mountains. Yet when this is examined in detail, there are numerous observations that suggest the behavior is more complex. We have identified heavily glaciated mountain ranges in tectonically active areas that may be eroding very slowly. There are also glaciated mountain ranges that may have experienced rapid erosion, despite being dominated by frozen beds (normally linked to slow erosion) and a lack of tectonic uplift. These observations suggest that there may be complex conditions that operate as thresholds for the onset of the extremely rapid, efficient glacial erosion. To test this, we will quantify what factors act as thresholds that control the response of mountain erosion to glaciation, including the factors of rock uplift rate, precipitation, and tectonic relief. This will be accomplished by expanding the case knowledge of glacial erosion controls, by quantifying chronologies of erosion rate over a range of timescales and erosive depths in four very different mountainous regions that span a range of conditions, including the Chugach and Kenai Ranges in Alaska, northwest Scotland, and the Presidential Range of New England. In each location we will test whether erosion accelerated with the onset of a specific stage of glacial development, by measuring erosion rates using several methods of radiogenic helium thermochronology (million year timescale) and cosmogenic dating, optically stimulated luminescence, and sedimentary records (spanning ten thousand to a hundred years). <br/><br/>By contributing to our understanding of erosion, climate, and tectonics, we will in effect help satisfy an innate human curiosity for how the landscape around us formed. We will also enable a better, more predictive understanding for how glacial and alpine landscapes respond to climate change, which is of timely, practical importance. In parallel with our research, our educational and museum outreach program will serve to connect to both students and the general public, kindling curiosity for Earth processes while conveying an experience of how geoscience problems are framed and tested through experimentation."

Understanding of these processes can be significantly improved though careful empirical examination of a well-characterized karst setting. Project will study the sources, transport mechanisms and isotopic fractionation of carbon in multiple caves of the karst system in central Texas. Specific hypotheses to be tested are: 1) the carbon isotope composition of dissolved inorganic carbon in cave drip water is strongly influenced by deeply rooted plants (C3 trees) and only minimally by shallowly rooted plants (grasses and herbs;, 2) CO2 is transported into these caves in both the gas and liquid phases; 3) calcite precipitated in the caves is not in C isotope equilibrium with water entering the caves and the kinetic isotope effects responsible for this disequilibrium occurs primarily by degassing of CO2 from drip water rather than by calcite precipitation; and 4) the magnitude of kinetic isotope effects varies seasonally, can be quantified, and may thus provide new applications to paleoclimatology.  <br/>The most important impact of the proposed research will be to provide a more useful tool for the speleothem and paleoclimate research community.

Although, currently, the contribution of dust emission from the southern hemisphere is relatively low, reductions in vegetation cover due to land use or climate change provide the potential for new source areas to emerge. The Kalahari Desert is a potentially large dust source in the Southern Hemisphere, which is prone to remobilization in response to possible losses of vegetation cover. Reactivation of the Kalahari dunes and subsequent emission of dust has the potential to cause considerable changes to the atmospheric composition and biogeochemical cycling of the Southern Hemisphere.

Moreover, it is not clear whether reactivated dunes could support the same biomass as the ecosystem in its stable state. The objective of the proposed research is to investigate the response of the Kalahari environment to changing climate and land use. It will assess changes in land cover and dust emissions resulting from the predicted aridification of interior southern Africa, large scale encroachment of woody plants, and increasing population and demand for animal products from this region dominated by pastoral land use. <br/><br/>This study will shed light on the large scale implications of climate change and overgrazing in one of the most vulnerable arid landscapes in the southern hemisphere.

These residence times can be readily interpreted in terms of erosion rates averaged over hundreds to thousands of years, making them nearly ideal in studies of landscape evolution and soil sustainability.  There are problems with the use of quartz, however.  It is not present in all landscapes and its chemical preparation requires the use of hazardous hydrofluoric acid, limiting the number of laboratories that are able to process samples.  This project will develop 10Be in magnetite as a new tool for determining catchment-averaged rates of erosion and weathering.  For most purposes, erosion rates from magnetite would be just as useful as erosion rates from quartz.  Magnetite, however, is easier to separate from other minerals and its chemical preparation is far less hazardous and expensive.  The project's contributions will include development of rapid, cost-effective mineral separation and chemical preparation techniques.  This should open the use of 10Be to a whole new community of researchers.  The project will test the method in three landscapes where erosion and weathering rates have been intensively studied.  In addition, it will explore the coupled use of 10Be in magnetite and quartz as a new, readily measured index of the catchment-averaged degree of chemical weathering.<br/><br/>Not long ago, it was extremely difficult to measure long-term rates of erosion and weathering, in part because the timescales of human observation are usually short compared to the timescales of landscape erosion. Over the last 20 or so years, cosmogenic nuclides such as 10Be in quartz have provided new tools for measuring rates of erosion and weathering averaged over hundreds to thousands of years. This has fueled a revolution in quantitative understanding of surface processes. Yet measurements of erosion rates in some landscapes have remained difficult because the preferred cosmogenic target mineral, quartz, is not present in all rock types. Hence cosmogenic-based erosion rates have rarely been measured in volcanic landscapes, for example. Moreover, all of the work on cosmogenic nuclides is done in just a few dozen labs around the world because quartz is not easy to prepare for analysis of 10Be, and costly, specialized equipment is needed to handle the large volumes of hazardous acids that are involved.  Usage of the mineral magnetite has the potential to overcome these difficulties.  10Be is produced within it in much the same way as it is in quartz.  It is present as a trace mineral in many rocks where quartz is absent.  Moreover, magnetite is easier to separate and dissolve than quartz.  Hence, techniques developed in this project promise to open the use of 10Be to new landscapes where quartz is absent, and also to new researchers who lack resources for the specialized equipment of quartz separation and dissolution.  Magnetite and quartz weather at different rates.  This raises the exciting possibility that 10Be in the mineral pair magnetite and quartz from the same stream will yield an index of chemical weathering in soil.  This research will focus on fieldwork at two of NSF's Critical Zone Observatories (Luquillo and Southern Sierra), thus capitalizing on existing infrastructure investment for studying weathering processes and their relationships with geology, climate, and ecology."

The project is motivated by the important role these environments play in the storage of sediments and associated contaminants, and the broad significance of these understudied systems to local ecosystems and human populations. The overarching goals of this study are to: 1) quantify the dominant processes governing the timing and magnitude of transport and trapping within tidal floodplain waterbodies; 2) evaluate the role these environments play in the storage of a river?s fine grained sedimentary budget; and 3) assess how sediment and associated contaminant storage rates vary in response to land-use changes, industrial development, and tidal influence. The lower reach of the Connecticut River exemplifies a tidal river with prominent tidal floodplain waterbodies and will serve as our field site. Our research approach combines water column observations, numerical model simulations, and an extensive coring campaign, and is designed to encompass all of the primary spatial and temporal scales necessary to constrain fine-grained trapping and storage.<br/><br/>Similar to low-lying coastlines around the world, the east coast of the U.S. is rich with tidal rivers and fringing tidal settings.

The mechanisms by which they achieve this against chemical equilibrium are poorly known. Our work showed that boring is likely driven by the action of membrane-bound Ca2+ transporting ATPases, powered directly by photosynthetically derived ATP, acting to maintain the levels of free Ca2+ in the interstitial space of the distal borehole very low, a situation that promotes local calcite dissolution, with Ca2+ then travelling intra-cellularly down a concentration gradient in the filament to be released into the outside medium. We intend here to advance our understanding of the boring mechanism at the molecular, genetic and cellular level and to test its universality, by probing its variability in essence or detail with respect to microbial agents other than the models previously used, and for mineral substrates other than CaCO3. We will achieve this through genetic and cellular characterization of the Ca2+ transport systems, molecular biology techniques and micro-imaging techniques based on confocal microscopy of model microbes.  We will also interrogate natural complex communities of boring microorganims from a variety of geographic and mineralogical settings (limestones, dolostones and biogenic carbonates) for their compliance with the Ca2+-transport mechanism. Finally, renewed efforts of cultivation will be used to address the mysterious excavation of phosphates, dolomite, and magnesite, a capacity that model microbes lacks, but is assumed to take place in nature.   <br/><br/>Moving from descriptive to mechanistic models of understanding, as this work will attempt, remains one of the frontiers of geobiology. The research will attempt to ascertain the exact mechanisms by which microbes can use the energy from the sun to power dissolving minerals like limestone, when geochemistry would predict they should not dissolve at all.  This knowledge would offer the potential to explain several biological and geological phenomena of widespread importance. For example, it will involve the study of physiology of calcium transport, the same phenomenon that drives muscle movement in humans, in a very different setting. It may also contribute to our ability to predict the consequences of global acidification of the oceans with respect to coastal limestone dissolution. It will contribute basic knowledge with potential applications in biomaterial science, potentially even providing a means for combating calcification in engineered systems, or for deterring the bio-deterioration of buildings and monuments. The research will be intricately embedded with activities in education, training, dissemination and outreach."

The problem is particularly acute in steep mountain streams where transport occurs close to the threshold of motion, and the resulting large-magnitude bed load pulses cannot be predicted using existing mathematical models. There are two unique aspects of mountain streams that we will examine here: (1) the presence of large, rarely-mobile boulders that generate large-scale fluid turbulence structures; and (2) highly energetic grain-grain collisions that cause coordinated motion of many particles. We will perform two parallel sets of laboratory experiments to examine the influence of these two factors on the formation and breakup of granular bed structures. Flow will be mapped using particle image velocimetry, while acoustic sensors will quantify bed load transport, pressure sensors will measure fluid stresses, and laser-induced fluorescence will be used to image the granular bed. These measurements will allow us to determine the relative contributions of fluid and granular stresses to bed load transport, and to develop a refined bed load transport equation that is better suited for prediction in mountain streams. We will test whether a recent framework developed in soft-matter physics, which unites the description of transport in a wide class of disordered systems, can be useful for understanding the statistical mechanics of sediment transport in rivers.<br/><br/>Floods erode streambanks, take out bridges and fill reservoirs with sediment. In steep mountain streams, large boulders form natural dams that can suddenly give way during a rain storm, sending catastrophic pulses of sediment downstream that endanger property and lives. These events occur infrequently, making it difficult to obtain the measurements required to understand the physical processes and to build predictive models. In this study we will use a set of scaled laboratory experiments, which allow us to effectively speed up time by scaling down size, to understand the physical processes driving the movement of boulders in mountain streams. We will measure the forces exerted on boulders by the moving water, and among boulders as they collide with each other, under carefully controlled conditions. We will then build a mathematical model that uses this physical understanding to predict when, and how much, boulders will move in floods of different magnitudes. This model will help Earth scientists studying the long-timescale evolution of eroding landscapes.

A leading hypothesis for the origin of hummocky moraine belts is that they formed from material that accumulated at the surface of a melting, stagnant ice mass. Uneven distribution of englacial and supraglacial sediment and water is expected to cause buried ice to melt at different rates, generating relief on the stagnant, debris-covered surface and promoting lateral and vertical re-sedimentation. While these re-sedimentation processes and the thermal and mechanical factors that control them have been well-described in modern glaciers with relatively thin debris-cover, the way in which they scale spatially and temporally to thicker debris blankets on Pleistocene ice sheets and the landscapes inherited from them is not presently clear. We plan to develop a physical and mathematical framework for modeling long-term ice melt under a thick (>0.5m) debris cover and to apply it to testing hypotheses for the origin of hummocky moraine and dominant variables in their formation.<br/><br/>This project aims to advance our understanding of and ability to predict melting of ice beneath a thick, insulating layer of rock debris. This problem not only underlies the long-term development of glacier-marginal landscapes (e.g., the hummocky moraine belts of the upper midwestern USA), but is fundamental in the discussion of water resource issues and geological hazards in many parts of the world. Retreating glaciers in places like the Himalayas are increasingly blanketed with rock debris as thinning exposes unstable rock in valley walls. This debris cover modulates glacier melt in a complex way, creating uncertainty among downstream communities in the volume and longevity of a key freshwater resource. Furthermore, debris accumulations atop melting ice have a tendency to be very unstable, creating flooding and debris-flow hazards to nearby people and infrastructure. Our research will combine several modeling tactics and tools, along with geospatial analysis and field observations, to better constrain the key processes and variables controlling melting and debris redistribution in these environments."

Results of a pilot study demonstrate the past existence of an ice cap covering over 200 square kilometers on the spectacular Chajnantor Plateau in the high, subtropical Andes of Northern Chile, where far too little snow falls to form glacial ice today. These new results raise several intriguing questions: How extensively glaciated was this arid part of the high Andes? How does the timing of the glaciation compare with other records of aridity and moistening from the region? What changes in precipitation and atmospheric circulation were required to develop and maintain these glaciers? What is the relative importance of glacial, periglacial, and glacially-related fluvial erosion processes in landscape evolution in arid settings? Addressing these questions is the goal of this project, which will proceed along three main fronts: 1) mapping and dating of glacial landforms, 2) numerical glacier modeling, and 3) climate modeling. The major component of the research is to establish a rigorous geomorphologic chronology for the Chajnantor Plateau and immediately adjacent areas of the Andes, Altiplano and Atacama Desert, specifically including the Tatio Geysers area about 70 km to the north. The brunt of the work will focus on glacial deposits and related features. The rocks of the area permit reliable measurement of in-situ produced cosmogenic isotopes such as 10Be, 26Al, and 36Cl. This allows dating of moraines, erratics, and glacially polished bedrock to describe not only periods of maximum ice expansion but also more detailed histories of glacial retreat.  The primary purpose of the glacier modeling will be to estimate the history of equilibrium line altitude and glacier mass balance as a paleoclimate proxy. In particular, it will be used to evaluate how much more precipitation is needed to sustain large ice bodies in the field area. This, in turn, will guide atmospheric modeling efforts by establishing a criterion that must be met by any proposed climate change mechanism. Atmospheric model experiments and diagnostics will be used to test climatological hypotheses that could explain the required precipitation increases in the subtropical Chilean Andes during glacial times. High-resolution regional models will be run to encompass approximately 30 years in both a modern control run and in an LGM scenario. <br/>Broader significance.<br/><br/>The history of glaciation and the climate mechanisms that modulate it are relatively well documented at high latitudes, but tropical and subtropical glacial histories are less robust. The subtropical Andes between 18 degrees S and 27 degrees S are presently unglaciated, even on mountains higher than 6 km, but show evidence of past glacial activity. The mountains in this region are easily cold enough to sustain glaciers today, but simply receive far too little snowfall. This project will establish when glaciers were last present and the amount of additional snowfall needed at that time to sustain them. This information is an important clue to understanding what was different about atmospheric circulation, i.e., climate, at that time to bring more moisture to the region. Therefore, this study will provide an important constraint on models of wetting and drying in the subtropics as a result of specific changes to climate. In other words, understanding the history of climate in the dry parts of the Andes contributes to predicting the impacts of climate change on water resource variability in arid subtropical areas. Additionally, the history of human occupation of the study area and the adjacent Atacama Desert are tied to the history of water in the region, which this study will help to resolve. This project is both international and cross-disciplinary in scope. It will establish additional scientific uses of the Chilean ""science preserve"" of the Chajnantor Plateau, where many astronomical observatories operate.

It has been widely used to estimate temporal changes of continental and hydrothermal inputs to seawater, and temporal variations have been correlated with periods of glaciations, mountain building and major magmatic events. Despite this impressive record, estimates of the present-day mass balance of strontium in seawater fundamentally disagree, highlighting the challenges of interpreting the marine strontium isotope record.<br/><br/>This project aims at investigating how severely present estimates of continental runoff into the ocean are biased, and how such biases can be corrected. The interpretation of the marine record critically hinges on an unbiased understanding of the present-day mass balance and forcing factors. In addition to the radiogenic (87Sr/86Sr) isotope composition, the stable (88Sr/86Sr) isotope signature may yield insights into the balance of silicate- vs carbonate-derived strontium, and thus the balance between silicate and carbonate weathering.<br/><br/>The study will be conducted under the umbrella of the Global Rivers Observatory, a collaborative, international network of scientists and community volunteers aimed at observing river systems in time-series fashion.

Trees act as powerful ""pumps"" to bring up soil water and groundwater, and as the soil wets and dries through the season, trees shift their water sources as needed.  The investigation will employ isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen to trace those shifts in a heavily instrumented biogeochemistry study site in central Pennsylvania, part of the NSF Critical Zone Observatory network.  At the same time as they acquire water, trees acquire nutrients from the soil.  Investigators will test ideas about how mineral nutrient sources may change as water sources change.  Trees take up nutrients they need, and when leaf drop occurs, recycle them to the soil.  One question is how important is the ""mining"" of nutrients from deep levels in the nutrient budget.  If trees cannot mine nutrients, then they are limited to the store that is in shallow soil and in standing vegetation. Some evidence suggests that in some species tree roots leak water to shallow soils - one possible explanation is that they do this to make nutrients available from otherwise dry, shallow soils during times of water stress.  Strontium isotopes and the ratios of germanium to silicon and strontium to calcium will be used to test these hypotheses more explicitly.  This builds on previous work on mineral nutrient cycles the investigators have carried out in tropical systems.<br/><br/>The response of forests and of biogeochemical cycles to climate change is an important consideration because of the possible feedbacks on the carbon and water cycles.  A prediction of most climate models is for more variable precipitation patterns, with increased periods of drought even under overall wetter conditions.  Water and nutrient acquisition strategies for species that are better suited to these variable conditions may predict success patterns among species in adapting to climate change in temperate forests.  Such species may also be able to increase their utilization of CO2 under increased CO2 levels if they are better able to acquire nutrients even under conditions of low soil water availability.  It is critical to improve our understanding of  the coupling between water and nutrient cycles in order to better predict the response of these important ecosystems to climate change, and their future impacts on the carbon and water cycles."

Two of the three O2-producing Mn-enzymatic reactions involve mineral-like structures --- these include disproportionation of H2O2 by Mn-catalase (a dimer-like structure) and oxidation of water by a four-Mn-Ca-oxide cluster (the water-oxidation-center, or WOC) in Photosystem II.  The WOC has long been compared to minerals that contain Mn-oxide cubane-like moieties, leading to chemist's models for these reactions, including such things as a MnIV,IV,IV,III -cubane oxide that resembles not only the CaMn4-oxide core of Photosystem-II but also the core of a birnessite-like MnO2 sheet.  We discovered that these molecules actually do convert to a birnessite-like structure under load in the photocatalytic cell---nanosheets of MnO2 form and it is these mineral-like sheets, not the delicate molecules, that perform the catalysis of water oxidation to O2.  The reaction is furthermore broadly similar to the biogeochemical cycling of manganese in the oceans---initial oxidation of aqueous Mn(II) leads to a Mn(III)/Mn(IV) solid oxide, which absorbs visible photons, photoexcites a O(2p)=>Mn(3d) ligand-to-metal-charge transfer and  disproportionate to release Mn2+(aq) and reactive oxygen species.  In this research project, we detail the pathways for the O2 production in these mineral-like MnO2 sheets.<br/><br/>Broader significance and importance.<br/><br/> 1) This project has strong implications for helping humans to find truly sustainable energy resources.  Human society needs to find a cheap, Earth-abundant catalyst that can help trap energy from visible light.  Earth-abundant materials, such as manganese oxides, are essential because the catalysts must work for 10 billion humans---catalysts made from rare elements are impossibly expensive.  Using minerals to trap light energy can also be advantageous, as they can last longer than more delicate catalysts.<br/><br/> 2) This project also has implications for understanding the origins of photosynthesis, and the relationship between the mineral components and biological systems of this planet.  We want to understand how a manganese-oxide mineral that was literally as common as dirt became the central enzyme for photosynthesis.  How did the transition occur between the soil mineral and the enzyme?  What energy source drove the reaction before there was O2 in the atmosphere?  <br/><br/>3) This work will help to strengthen a US-Australia scientific collaboration, as well as the international training of a US student.

In addition to the small Shale Hills catchment, the CZO includes a suite of satellite sites that overly the same bedrock type (shale) but which are situated in different climate regimes. One additional satellite site is located on organic-rich Marcellus shale. These satellites allow researchers to understand how climate and organic content control water flow and soil formation while working with minority-and undergrad-serving institutions.  CZO researchers are investigating i) new methodologies to model the age and chemistry of water as it moves from the atmosphere to groundwater; ii) new techniques to synthesize measurements of soil moisture for incorporation into land-atmosphere models; iii) observations that constrain water, energy, and solute fluxes related to trees; iv) models that quantify how soil grows on shale; v) new uses of isotopes to measure soil formation; and vi) observations concerning how variables describing characteristics at depth such as the fracture distribution in bedrock combine with features at Earth's surface such as the sunniness of hillslopes to control the evolution of soils and hillslopes over time. Datasets of isotopes, chemistry, soil moisture, CO2 and energy flux, LiDAR, sapflux, and other observables collected at high spatial and temporal resolution are published online.

These observatories are to provide an unprecedented intensity and scale of scientific observations, where interdisciplinary scientists come together to test hypotheses, identify ecosystem processes and measure their rates, develop mathematical models, and make use of multiple sensors and sampling methods. By now, 60 observatories are established in 25 countries and scientists from diverse disciplines are now actively engaged in developing a concerted international research effort that explicitly links CZOs and Critical Zone research to the global sustainability agenda. <br/><br/>This proposal requests support to hold an international workshop on CZ processes in China to promote collaboration between Chinese and US scientists. For this, the meeting will also promote the CZO concept among Chinese scientists, involving Chinese funding agencies in supporting the CZ research. The second objective is to train young scientists and students in the CZ science. The third objective is to identify possible CZO sites in China so that they can join the international network. The principal investigator (PI) will work closely with the Chinese counterparts to arrange logistics. Following 2-3 day plenary sessions and small group discussions, the participants will visit a red soil field site in Jiangxi Province, China. The PI and Chinese collaborators will implement various methods to sustain the international activities for the long term. <br/><br/>The workshop will address globally significant research questions and will greatly advance our understanding of the complex interactions between the atmosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere. These topics are of interest to geologists, microbiologists, geochemists, hydrologists, civil and environmental engineers, and the general public with broad theoretical and practical implications. The workshop is most likely to stimulate integrated multidisciplinary research among the US, the European, and Chinese scientists. The workshop report will be placed on the workshop website.

The CT scanner at UT was specifically designed to enable x-ray tomography of a range of geological materials and sample sizes.  The technology was developed from commercial biomedical CAT scanners with the adoption of a higher energy x-ray source and higher resolution CCD detectors to allow micron-scale imaging of geological samples.  The technique allows for completely non-destructive imaging of the exteriors and interiors of samples.  Differences in x-ray attenuation that occur due to variations in sample density and the elemental composition of the material along the x-ray path are digitally recorded by a CCD.  Samples are mounted on a rotating table in front of the x-ray source.  Radial 2-d slices of the attenuated x-rays are stacked by vertical translation of the sample table.  Resultant x-ray ?sinograms? are then reduced via computer algorithms to render high resolution 3-D images of the density distributions within samples.  A ongoing upgrade of the UTCT high energy system will increase both resolution and scanning speed, lowering costs for lab clients and opening a multitude of new research possibilities. In particular, it will enable ?4D? scanning of systems in motion (during fluid flow, cooling, heating, strain, etc.). Exploration and exploitation of these new capabilities for an expanded range of studies including studies of fluid flow through fractured and porous media with relevance to groundwater hydrology, hydrocarbon reservoir extraction enhancement and carbon dioxide subsurface sequestration will be enabled by this renewal award.  Continued support will benefit a large and diverse set of research constituencies.

This architecture reflects evolution in response to geologic processes and climate.  The work addresses fundamental questions, such as: How does rock turn to sediment? How do landscapes evolve? What controls water, sediment, dissolved mineral and nutrient fluxes?  What services do ecosystems provide?  The Colorado Front Range is used as a natural laboratory for these questions; it typifies mountainous areas of the American West that support large human populations, and it bears legacies from a varied geologic and climatic history.

Future-casting hydrologic and ecosystem states to 2050 will be undertaken.  Research on snow, the geobiology of deep weathering, the roles of slope aspect, and the use of cosmogenic radionuclides connects BcCZO to other CZOs across the country.<br/><br/>In addition to training graduate students and post-docs, BcCZO will engage secondary students and teachers in CZ science, reach out to underrepresented minority students, and produce simulation modules for public education.  Through partnership with CU Science Discovery, BcCZO will develop a Field Course for Colorado secondary teachers, a Mountain Research Experience for high school students, and offer traveling School and Community science programs.   A graduate researcher will transform CZ models into interactive simulations, tested by Science Discovery students and teachers, and contributed to the Science Education Resource Center (SERC)."

During the first phase of the Luquillo Critical Zone Observatory (LCZO1), investigators identified differences in rock type, deep weathering, geomorphology, and topography as the dominant drivers of key CZ processes such as nutrient supply, greenhouse gas emissions, and water quantity and quality. Building on this foundation, LCZO2 will evaluate the role of ""hot spots and hot moments"" in the CZ: locations or time periods that disproportionately impact the environment as a whole. ""Hot spots and hot moments"" are particularly relevant to humid tropical environments such as the LCZO, which are characterized by high physical, geochemical, and biological diversity in space and time. Critical zone processes can occur at very small to very large spatial scales. For example, bedrock weathering occurs at a millimeter spatial scale, while wholesale changes in vegetation and carbon cycling occur over several kilometers such as along elevation gradients. Critical zone processes can also vary over time; oxidation-reduction reactions occur in soils on the scale of minutes, and catastrophic events such as hurricanes and landslides occur at decadal time scales. Investigators will identify, quantify, and model the role of ""hot spots and hot moments"" in a range of CZ processes and use that knowledge to predict the rates of CZ processes across the Luquillo Mountains and in other montane areas with high temperature and rainfall. Specific focal areas include: 1) the importance of knickpoints and landscape position as hot spots for weathering, soil development, and biogeochemical cycling; 2) the role of ""hot spots and hot moments"" in redox fluctuations and mineral weathering for C and nutrient retention and loss; 3) the role of ""hot spots"" for sediment production and ""hot moments"" in stream flow for the transport of sediment, C, and nutrients from mountains to the sea; and 4) the development of climate and hydrologic models to scale up ""hot spots and hot moments"" in time and space. The data collected and synthesized will transform the understanding of the controls on key CZ processes such as weathering, soil development, C and nutrient storage and loss, soil and sediment transport, and ultimately landscape evolution and the effects of climate change. The project will provide an unprecedented level of detail on ""hot spots and hot moments"" in a tropical system. The results of this research will allow us to accurately and precisely 'earthcast' the effects of environmental change on important environmental processes such as flooding, erosion, and landslides. Because all critical zones have ""hot spots and hot moments"" of significant environmental processes, the development of the ""hot spots and hot moments"" concept in the CZ context will promote cross-site integration, the development of conceptual models of the CZ, and provide a venue for the Earth science community to develop and test novel approaches to CZ science.<br/><br/>The LCZO2 will continue to collaborate with University of Puerto Rico (UPR) students and scientists to enhance the participation of underrepresented groups in the Earth and environmental sciences. LCZO2 will also contribute to an existing 'Schoolyard' environmental education program at high schools in Puerto Rico. This program has a successful record of incorporating new data and research techniques into the curriculum and provides professional development for the teachers in addition to research opportunities for students.  The diverse group of co-PIs, senior personnel, and collaborators will provide strong role models for research students and postdocs. Our robust collaborations with local and federal agencies and educational institutions provide access to policy makers and other stakeholders that will help us to translate science into policy-relevant findings. Informal forums will be used to share our research findings and to emphasize the significance of CZ research to environmental decision makers dealing with questions such as soil erosion that can fill reservoirs, water quality that degrades water supply and coral reefs, and carbon storage that counteracts the effects of global increases in carbon dioxide.  An inclusive and comprehensive engagement plan will encourage participation by scientists not yet affiliated with the LCZO2.  The plans for cross-CZO modeling, open sharing of data and samples, and cyberseminars that are open to the public will strengthen the CZO network as a whole and enhance the availability of CZ science to the public and decision-makers."

Scientists consider these systems to be ""integrated"" because aboveground climate, plants, animals, and human management all interact with the belowground biology, chemistry, and physics from surface soils to deep aquifers. A new Calhoun Critical Zone Observatory (CZO) is located in the USA's Southern Piedmont that extends from Virginia to Alabama, a region characterized by ancient, deep, and highly weathered landscapes that between 1800 to 1950 experienced some of the most severe agricultural soil erosion and land and water degradation in America.  The new Calhoun-CZO leverages more than 60 years of research on land degradation and recovery based at the USDA Forest Service's Calhoun Experimental Forest in Union County, SC.  The CZO researchers and educators are from Duke University, University of Georgia, Georgia Tech, University of Kansas, Mississippi State University, Roanoke College, as well as the USDA Forest Service. <br/><br/>A key objective of the Calhoun CZO is to help integrate land management, disturbance, and recovery into CZ science.  To that end, the scientists include hydrologists, soil scientists, agriculturists and foresters, geochemists, ecologists, and modelers but also an environmental historian and anthropologist.  The overall hypothesis is that land use accelerates CZ processes associated with vegetation, atmosphere, water, and surface soils, thereby stressing temporal and spatial networks that connect surface and deep subsurface components and processes of the CZ.  Land degradation may even isolate the CZ's surface from its subsurface components with adverse long-term consequences to water quality, soil fertility, and plant productivity.  Researchers will focus their studies on CZ evolution, rates of recovery from land degradation, and CZ re-integration.<br/><br/>The Calhoun-CZO is a center for research and education.  The CZO is linked to a Duke University IGERT-training center on intelligent sensor networks, annual CZO science meetings will have oral and poster presentations, discussions, and training sessions that involve scientists and students on equal footing. We plan several kinds of outreach efforts to local, regional, and national publics with multi-media science, history, and community-based pieces from hardcover books to op-eds to Facebook and Twitter.  An important emphasis of the CZO is on undergraduate research and education.   Central to this effort will be the development of a set of classroom-tested, web-based laboratory and classroom activities for undergraduates and advanced high school students based, in part, on real-time and historic data from the Calhoun CZO."

The overarching scientific objectives of the CRB-CZO were established in 2009 to test two related hypotheses: 1) Hydrological, chemical, and biological processes that produce and mix mineral surfaces and organic carbon are rate limiting to watershed scale chemical weathering, soil production, and carbon sequestration; and: 2) Humans accelerate rates of carbon-mineral mixing, resulting in anthropogenic carbon sequestration significant to local, regional, and global budgets.  The extended CRB-CZO team examined these hypotheses within the 6th-order CRB watershed of Southeastern Pennsylvania and Southern Delaware with a suite of long-term studies organized into 4 inter-related objective areas: 1) Carbon-mineral-microbe-water interactions, 2) Co-evolution of critical zone structure, hydro-bio-geo-chemical function and carbon complexation, 3) Mobilization, transport & depositional controls on carbon-mineral supply, mixing, and burial, and 4) Saprolite to sea integration of erosion-driven carbon sequestration.  CRB-CZO studies investigate scales varying from individual mineral grains to entire watersheds, and involve field, lab, and modeling approaches.  <br/><br/>This 1-year award will fund 14 investigators from 5 institutions to finalize ongoing research on these topics. In addition, the CRB-CZO team will also finalize installation of sensor stations in the streams draining study watersheds with different ""endmember"" land uses (forest, agriculture, and disturbed) as an investment in future studies.  The research plan also outlines opportunities to pursue ongoing funding beyond the NSF CZO program.  <br/><br/>CRB-CZO research activities under this 1-year award will finalize training of approximately 8 PhD students and result in numerous publications in peer-reviewed journals and presentations at scientific meetings.

Indeed, soils store approximately three times more carbon than the atmosphere. Yet large uncertainties exist as to whether soils will release carbon to the atmosphere faster than they can take it up when disturbed or experiencing new environmental conditions or extremes. These uncertainties arise owing to an incomplete understanding of the processes controlling soil carbon fate and the challenge of scaling up estimates of soil carbon from the plot to the landscape or global level.<br/><br/>Investigators are establishing the Reynolds Creek Critical Zone Observatory (RC CZO) to address the grand challenge of improving prediction of soil carbon storage and the processes governing its fate at the plot to the landscape scale. The RC CZO will be co-located with the Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed (RCEW) in southwest Idaho, which has been administered by the United State Department of Agriculture -Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS) for over 50 years. The RCEW is particularly well suited for the CZO because of its strong gradients in climate, vegetation, and distributions of soil organic and inorganic carbon. The observatory will leverage existing scientific infrastructure that includes long-term, spatially extensive meteorological and soil monitoring.<br/><br/>An interdisciplinary team of scientists from Idaho State University, Boise State University, and the USDA-ARS will focus their initial efforts on extensive characterization of above and below ground plant biomass and soil carbon amounts and characteristics across the watershed. An intensively instrumented set of sites (CORE) along an elevation gradient will include measurements of evapotranspiration and the associated land-atmosphere exchange of carbon, sap flux, soil respiration, soil moisture, soil temperature, and other essential climate variables. Experimental research will include investigation of prescribed fire and grazing on soil carbon and processes. The CORE site data will support efforts to improve modeling of the soil-vegetation-atmosphere system and provide a rich dataset for collaborations. A suite of simulation tools will be used to distribute controlling climate input variables at a sufficiently high resolution to capture the natural heterogeneity on the landscape and predict the distribution of soil carbon and other key ecological and hydrologic stores and fluxes throughout the watershed. <br/><br/>This CZO will produce one of the largest coupled soil carbon- environmental variable datasets available. The dataset will provide a unique calibration target to develop and test modeling tools critical for regional and global climate and biogeochemical modeling. The intermediate scale research at the RC CZO will improve our ability to scale local observations to the landscape and the globe; an essential step to support accurate Earth system modeling. Evaluation of simulations at the intermediate scale will reveal areas of weakness in process representation and allow researchers to identify critical research needs. This CZO will become a community resource for carbon cycling research and education, and a magnet for global soil modeling community research to address the grand challenge of understanding soil carbon behavior. This observatory will also improve understanding of how land management activities like prescribed fire and grazing alter soil properties, carbon inputs and the fate of soil organic carbon at the landscape level.  In additional to traditional training, this CZO will develop a field methods course on critical zone processes and develop K-12 curriculum to improve literacy of soils in the critical zone."

However, the intensity of change is responsible for unintended deterioration of our land and water environments. By understanding present day dynamics in the context of long-term co-evolution of the landscape, soil and biota, IML-CZO aims to support the assessment of short- and long-term resilience of the crucial ecological, hydrological and climatic services. These include freshwater quality and quantity, provision for food, fiber and (bio)fuel, nutrient transformations, and terrestrial carbon storage. The goals of this project are to quantify the fluxes and transformations, as well as interactions, thresholds, and dynamic feedbacks of water, nutrients, and sediment in IMLs, and to characterize how rapid land use changes have altered the vulnerability and resilience of these systems. An observational network of two sites in Illinois (3,690-km2 Upper Sangamon River Basin) and Iowa (270-km2 Clear Creek Watershed), and a partner site in Minnesota (44,000-km2 Minnesota River Basin), which together capture a range of geological diversity of the low relief glaciated and tile-drained landscape in the Midwest, will drive the scientific and technological advances. The guiding hypothesis for the scientific effort is that through human modification, the critical zone of IMLs has passed a tipping point (or threshold) and has changed from being a transformer of material flux, with high nutrient, water, and sediment storage, to being a transporter. This change threatens the resilience of the landscape to accommodate future impacts associated with ongoing human activity, including climate change and bioenergy crop production. Further, it increases the vulnerability of IMLs by compromising the sustainability of key critical-zone services on which ecological systems and human populations depend. Understanding and quantifying shifts in the response of the critical zone to human development remains a challenge, and current assessments are at best qualitative. IML-CZO research will identify threats to resilience of the critical zone, and will also inform management strategies aimed at reducing the vulnerability of the system to human activities that threaten sustainability. We will develop methods and knowledgebase that are broadly applicable across the Midwest and similar low-gradient landscapes worldwide. <br/><br/>The project will provide leadership in developing the next generation of work force and informing sustainable management strategies. The IML-CZO will be a launch pad for several new educational and outreach initiatives, and it will be an integral resource to connect and partner with existing organizations. It will draw on and add to several resources and programs available throughout the region. The CZO will provide a testbed for student-led sensing and data collection initiatives, and is expected to stimulate new research ideas and further advance the sensors and measurements curriculum. The CZO will also work to bring together collaborations with National Great Rivers Research and Education Center, IOWATER, Minnesota and Illinois RiverWatch Volunteer programs to enlist ""citizen scientist"" (age 10 - 70) in the work of the CZO.  IML-CZO will also serve as a training ground for several undergraduate and graduate students, and post-doctoral research associates by engaging them in interdisciplinary research."

We are pioneering low-cost, accurate measurement systems and use of the measurements to drive advanced earth systems modeling for predictions.  We work closely with regional stakeholders and use our results to assess options available to resource managers to enhance management of forests, water and other ecosystem services, given environmental change.<br/><br/>The SSCZO is also a community platform for research on critical-zone (CZ) processes, both locally and as part of the broader CZO national network. It lies along a steep elevation transect where precipitation grades from dominantly rain to dominantly snow and ecosystems range from oak savannah biomes to subalpine forests. Spatial gradients in CZ properties and processes permit substitution of space for time, making the SSCZO an excellent natural laboratory for studying how the CZ responds to disturbance and how the water cycle drives CZ processes. SSCZO research involves a core SSCZO team from 6 campuses, plus collaborators and cooperators from other institutions who use SSCZO data and other resources in their research. SSCZO resources include 4 focal sites spanning a 3000-meter elevation range with gradients in climate, regolith properties, soils, vegetation and material cycles. Measurements are intensive and detailed, including 4 flux towers, meteorological stations, soil lysimeters, groundwater wells, and over 1000 continuous sensors for snow depth, soil moisture, streamflow, water quality and sap flow.<br/><br/>The SSCZO provides a platform for research in a landscape with vital importance to society, yet poorly understood in its potential response to climate warming. The twin threats of a changing climate and land-use practices raise fundamental questions about the sustainability of CZ services in the semi-arid U.S. West, which depends heavily on seasonally snow-covered mountains for many of these services. The Sierra Nevada provides ecosystem services, ranging from water to biodiversity, to a large fraction of California's and thus the nation's population. SSCZO partnerships with federal, state, and local resource-management agencies show the interest that decision makers have in using both research results and SSCZO technology to improve predictive capabilities. SSCZO will provide data and lessons to enhance the science experience of thousands of middle- and high-school students, several undergraduate students and the public."

These connections arise in a deep, unexplored landscape of weathered bedrock, populated by microbes, that lies beneath the hillslope surface and below the soil mantle and above a fresh bedrock boundary.  Rain and snow melt can penetrate this weathered bedrock, be held as rock moisture and be exploited by trees, which return this moisture to the atmosphere through release (transpiration) from leaves. Bedrock properties influence how much moisture is available to plants, so in turn may determine which species can persist, especially in seasonally dry environments.  The water released by trees influences air humidity and temperature, and the tree type affects how much solar energy is reflected or absorbed.  Collectively these feedbacks influence atmospheric energy and circulation (and momentum). Rain and snow melt also penetrate to the underlying fresh bedrock boundary where water perches and flows as groundwater to streams through the weathered bedrock.  This can control the timing, magnitude, and chemistry of runoff to rivers, especially during summer low flow periods.  Hence, river ecosystems and the coastal oceans (where rivers discharge) are recipients of water and nutrients derived from deep inside hillslopes. The entire zone from vegetation canopy down through the soil and weathered bedrock to the start of fresh bedrock is referred to as the ?critical zone.?  This zone mediates these ?watershed currencies?-- water, sediment, solutes (dissolved elements in water), gases, organisms, energy and momentum?that are exchanged and transformed in the course of biological and physical interactions across landscapes.  PIs propose to establish the Eel River Critical Zone Observatory in Northern California for intensive field investigations of key mechanisms controlling these currencies and their consequences for water resources and ecosystem sustainability. Eel River CZO scientists will build models to explore how these currencies are exchanged among atmosphere, hillslopes, rivers and coastal oceans to investigate fundamental questions and to provide guidance for management issues.  <br/>  <br/>PIs identify four key frontier questions: 1) Do plants in seasonally dry environments rely on moisture from the weathered bedrock beneath the soil and if so how might bedrock properties then affect this availability and thus the resilience of vegetation to climate change? 2) As moisture conditions change, how do microbes in the critical zone influence the water chemistry and gasses discharged from hillslopes? 3) What controls the spatial extent of channels that remain wet (standing or flowing water) in the network of channels draining seasonally dry environments? and 4) Will changes in critical zone currencies, induced by climate or land use change,  lead to sudden shifts in river and coastal ecosystems? Motivated by anticipated increase in climate extremes (especially extended drought) and accelerating societal demand for water, PIs focus on filling knowledge gaps that not only inhibit our ability to forecast the magnitude of future change of systems, but even the sign of that change. The Eel River CZO will be locally rooted in the Angelo Coast Range Reserve (in Northern California), but will extend to watershed and regional scales.  It will be dedicated to detecting, explaining, and predicting driving mechanisms that connect watershed currencies to processes that operate in the critical zone.  We will also develop a model which will provide local predictions over a regional scale that can be used to ask ""what if"" questions about possible future climate and landuse scenarios, and the consequences for runoff and ecosystem conditions.<br/><br/>The Eel River CZO will produce a generation of students and postdocs who have worked together across the disciplines of climate science, hydrology, ecology, geobiology, geochemistry and geomorphology and who have made discoveries at the interface of these fields. There will be strong interactions with other CZOs. PIs will actively work with resource managers and watershed residents to share and generate knowledge and collaborate to build resource and ecosystem resilience, specifically in the Eel and Russian River coastal watersheds. They will focus on these watersheds, but anticipate our findings and modeling will then be expanded to a much broader region. Environmental change will come: the need for well-informed guidance and tools will accelerate. It is only through coupling mechanistic field studies and integrated modeling as proposed here that we can forecast and offer tools for decision makers to guide the future state of landscapes and their ecosystem functions and services"

CUAHSI will continue its successful activities from the past, including Pathfinder graduate student travel grants, Research Cyberseminars, Let's Talk about Water outreach events, and the Biennial Water Science Symposia. A new initiative is the development of a community governance process and community modeling resources designed to enable the water science community to more readily contribute its knowledge of continental water processes to Earth Systems models. This will be a collaborative effort with NCAR to develop a water-oriented branch of the Community Land Model (CLM), that would be supported by the Water Data Center, and empower the community toward improving the model realism in large-scale water storages and fluxes in climate and Earth system simulations. Strategic planning activities are incorporated into the core governance of CUAHSI. <br/><br/>Because water connects the biotic and abiotic components of the Earth system and is a critical economic and ecological resource, CUAHSI services impact multiple disciplines and serve society at large. The WDC will enable new synthetic research, and better sharing and dissemination of research data and results that can be utilized in applied and policy research. The advancement of standards for water data ensures free and better exchange of information between academics, federal agencies and the private sector. CUAHSI Hydrologic Information System is being used by multiple governments around the world (the Dominican Republic and the Republic of Italy). The WDC will also target outreach activities to the Native American community through tribal colleges and tribal government. Water management is a major issue at many reservations and water science provides an attractive career path for Native Americans with jobs available at all degree levels. Training and outreach activities will provide important training and research opportunities for graduate students to explore meaningful and important interdisciplinary questions. Advancement of water science depends on such investments in part because of the many traditional disciplines that are required for an understanding of water in the Earth system. CUAHSI seeks to overcome fragmentation in water science research by supporting interdisciplinary science. The services included in this project have been selected to provide maximum benefit to the community as well as to serve as a foundation for the advancement of the science."

The Critical Zone is Earth's permeable near-surface layer - from the atmosphere at the vegetation's canopy to the lower boundary of actively circulating groundwaters. The Critical Zone was a term coined by the National Research Council's Basic Research Opportunities in the Earth Sciences (BROES) Report (2001) to highlight the imperative for a new approach to thoroughly multi-disciplinary research on the zone of the Earth?s surface that is critical to sustaining terrestrial life on our planet. In January 2013, 103 members of the CZ community met for the CZ-EarthCube Domain Workshop (NSF Award #1252238) to prioritize the CZ community's key science drivers, key computational and information technology (""cyber"") challenges and key cyber needs. They identified that the central scientific challenge of the critical zone science community is to develop a ""grand unifying theory"" of the critical zone through a theory-model-data fusion approach.  Work participants unanimously described that the key missing need of this approach was a future cyberinfrastructure for seamless 4D visual exploration of the integrated knowledge (data, model outputs and interpolations) from all the bio and geoscience disciplines relevant to critical zone structure and function, similar to today?s ability to easily explore historical satellite imagery and photographs of the earth's surface using Google Earth.

LiDAR technology is capable of resolving vegetation, terrain, and snowpack data at extremely high resolutions using ground-based (terrestrial) and aircraft-mounted laser ranging equipment. The growth of LiDAR data collection has outpaced the potential for CZ scientists to learn about new analysis techniques needed for research applications, which has left the CZ community 'data-rich' but 'information-poor' regarding LiDAR data. The workshop is therefore an important opportunity for early-career scientists to meet and learn about transformative LiDAR analysis tools and better utilize the LiDAR datasets already collected by the National Science Foundation's Critical Zone Observatory (CZO) network and similar CZ field sites from around the world. The workshop has three clear objectives: 1. Inform early-career CZ scientists on cutting-edge LiDAR analysis techniques, 2. Identify opportunities to apply LiDAR analysis techniques across the disciplinary boundaries of CZ science, and 3. Develop a five-year vision for advancing CZ science with new LiDAR data products that is articulated in a discussion paper. For one day of the workshop the instructors will rotate between three topical groups: 1. Watershed hydrology, 2. Forest ecology and management, and 3. Geomorphic landforms and lithology. The second half of the workshop will be spent synthesizing these ideas into a vision for advancing CZ science using transdisciplinary LiDAR analysis techniques to be published in a top-level peer-reviewed Earth science journal. The workshop offers a unique opportunity to develop collaborations among multidisciplinary early-career CZ scientists working with LiDAR data from around the world and engage the wider CZ community using course materials and journal publications."

Bed load transport - the movement of sediment in frequent contact with the river bottom - remains notoriously unpredictable, despite almost a century of quantitative research. The problem is particularly acute in steep mountain streams where transport occurs close to the threshold of motion, and the resulting large-magnitude bed load pulses cannot be predicted using existing mathematical models. There are two unique aspects of mountain streams that we will examine here: (1) the presence of large, rarely-mobile boulders that generate large-scale fluid turbulence structures; and (2) highly energetic grain-grain collisions that cause coordinated motion of many particles. We will perform two parallel sets of laboratory experiments to examine the influence of these two factors on the formation and breakup of granular bed structures. Flow will be mapped using particle image velocimetry, while acoustic sensors will quantify bed load transport, pressure sensors will measure fluid stresses, and laser-induced fluorescence will be used to image the granular bed. These measurements will allow us to determine the relative contributions of fluid and granular stresses to bed load transport, and to develop a refined bed load transport equation that is better suited for prediction in mountain streams. We will test whether a recent framework developed in soft-matter physics, which unites the description of transport in a wide class of disordered systems, can be useful for understanding the statistical mechanics of sediment transport in rivers.<br/><br/>Floods erode streambanks, take out bridges and fill reservoirs with sediment. In steep mountain streams, large boulders form natural dams that can suddenly give way during a rain storm, sending catastrophic pulses of sediment downstream that endanger property and lives. These events occur infrequently, making it difficult to obtain the measurements required to understand the physical processes and to build predictive models. In this study we will use a set of scaled laboratory experiments, which allow us to effectively speed up time by scaling down size, to understand the physical processes driving the movement of boulders in mountain streams. We will measure the forces exerted on boulders by the moving water, and among boulders as they collide with each other, under carefully controlled conditions. We will then build a mathematical model that uses this physical understanding to predict when, and how much, boulders will move in floods of different magnitudes. This model will help Earth scientists studying the long-timescale evolution of eroding landscapes. Results will also be useful for engineers and managers charged with protecting and maintaining infrastructure, and restoring natural river function, in mountain settings. In addition, this grant will provide important training for future scientists, as the experiments will be led by a doctoral student and post-doctoral researcher, and also involve several undergraduate students."

The retention of sediment upstream behind dams and confinement of major rivers by levees have resulted in diminished sediment delivery to coastal regions, exacerbating problems of land subsidence. Along the US Gulf Coast this loss of land may be lessened through engineered diversions of the Mississippi River that would deliver sediment to a larger portion of the delta plain. Simulation modeling is an essential tool for planning such diversions and evaluating impacts of different management scenarios on rates of coastal sedimentation and erosion. However, a gap in knowledge of the different processes contributing to coastal sediment budgets could lead to inaccurate model predictions of these rates. One of these unknown processes is the direct capture of particles by the stems and leaves of coastal vegetation, which in deltaic marshes might add substantially to overall sedimentation rates. This research will quantify the importance of vegetation capture for coastal sedimentation budgets, leading to improved prediction of coastal growth or submersion.<br/><br/>A technical description of the project<br/><br/>This project addresses three outstanding topics in documenting the role of fine sediment in coastal land building processes: (i) It develops a quantitative relationship between hydrodynamic properties, biofilm and vegetation properties, and sedimentation through direct capture by vegetation. (ii) It tests the hypothesis that the presence of biofilm within vegetation arrays substantially increases sedimentation rates. (iii) It improves the representation of particle capture by vegetation in models of delta land dynamics and uses the model to evaluate the overall significance of particle capture in large-scale delta evolution. A combination of laboratory and field experimentation and numerical modeling will be used to elucidate these topics. Laboratory experiments in the Biogeomorphology Research and Teaching (BRAT) flume will test emerging theory about the functional relationship between flow conditions, particle characteristics, and vegetation canopy structure. Biofilms cultivated within the flume will enable testing of the effects of different surficial properties on sedimentation. These results will be tested in the field, within in situ flumes constructed around intact vegetation communities in the Wax Lake Delta, an actively growing portion of the Louisiana coast. Functional relationships developed in the field and laboratory flumes will be incorporated into a Delft 3D model of delta sedimentation dynamics. Sensitivity analyses conducted with the model will evaluate the importance of fine sediment-vegetation interactions for large-scale delta growth. Educational components of the project include development of experiential course modules that use the BRAT flume, development of a summer short course on fine sediment-vegetation interactions at the National Center for Earth Dynamics, and development of an exhibit for the San Francisco Exploratorium on the role of coastal marshes in land building processes. Delta modeling efforts will be developed in collaboration with coastal resource managers and disseminated broadly for Louisiana coastal marsh restoration planning."

Barnhart has been granted an NSF EAR Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out research and education plans at the University of Colorado and University of Kansas. The project seeks to assess the mechanisms responsible for initiating debris flows - water-laden slurries of soil and rock from landslides - that move rapidly through channels in steep landscapes and present hazards to human life, infrastructure and property.  To benefit the public, the outcomes of this project will include a landscape evolution model incorporating processes responsible for the recharge of debris, and processes responsible for the actual debris flow initiation. This model will improve predictions and risk assessment in debris flow prone areas. For the education component of this project, Dr. Barnhart will develop a senior-undergraduate and first-year graduate student course focused on the philosophy of science as applied to the geosciences and an investigation into the ingredients of a good research question.<br/><br/>Debris flows are among the most dangerous and frequent natural hazards; once initiated in a steep region, a debris flow can continue to travel over shallow terrain, greatly extending the hazard, frequently destroying houses and covering streets with mud, which is costly to remove. Models for debris flows that relate antecedent conditions (e.g., soil moisture) and external forcing (e.g., surface hydrodynamic stresses) provide an opportunity for mechanistic understanding and prediction of natural debris flows. However, the steep and difficult terrain in debris flow prone regions precludes the observation of initiation zones which, in turn, prevents attribution of debris recharge and flow initiation to specific mechanisms. The project will employ novel methods -including drone-based photography- to make observations within the steep terrain in debris-flow initiation zones. Maps of topography and sediment characteristics will be made from these images which will constrain numerical models for (1) the amount and size distribution of material delivered to the channel between debris flow events, (2) the timing and (3) mechanisms of debris flow initiation."

Despite this central role, knowledge of the processes of soil formation is still very rudimentary. Microbial activity has a principal role in breaking down rocks into fertile soil and identifying the major mechanisms and types of microorganisms is an ongoing research activity. Fungi are a class of these microbes that have received little attention, but likely are very important contributors to soil generation.

These will be tested by collecting soil samples along a climate gradient, and then interrogate these samples by using DNA and aquaporin (integral membrane proteins) analyses, and microscopic and spectroscopic techniques. The project will use the Catalina-Jemez Critical Zone Observatories and the Landscape Evolution Observatory at Biosphere 2 of University of Arizona, which provide opportunities to study processes along a climate gradient.

The Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System (CSDMS) supports scientific research into these and other Earth-surface processes: soil erosion, glaciation, river sedimentation, coastal change, sea-floor processes, and many natural phenomena that can impact human life and infrastructure. CSDMS focuses on the development and applications of computer models that help researchers and other professionals understand these processes and their potential impacts on human activity. The organization provides support in three main areas: community, computing, and education. Community-oriented activity includes maintaining an interactive online database for sharing of research software and other resources, hosting an annual scientific conference, and providing logistical support for workshops and related events. Computing-related services include developing software technology for running and coupling process models, hosting high-performance computing resources, providing technical computing assistance to scientists, and designing and promoting common standards and best practices for research software. Educational activities include workshops on various technical topics, and a web-based repository of online educational materials, such as animations, lecture slides, and laboratory exercises.<br/><br/>The CSDMS community addresses a broad range of scientific questions that bear on Earth's surface, its stratigraphy, and their changes over time. A fundamental goal is to develop an ever-improving body of knowledge that predicts the dynamics of Earth's surface: how the physics, biology, and chemistry of formative processes operate, how the movement of sediments and solutes shapes the seascape and landscape, how the system reacts to natural and human forcing, and how the processes give rise to bathymetry, topography, and stratigraphy. CSDMS cyberinfrastructure developments address fundamental challenges in integration and standardization of scientific software by designing interface standards and providing framework services. Building on major CSDMS advances of the past five years, new technology planned for the next phase will allow for easy pathways from model user to model developer, through an expanded CSDMS software stack. Enhancing core functionality to allow for smooth data-model integration will offer a step change in model validation, uncertainty quantification, and model-data synthesis opportunities. New geospatial capabilities in the suite of robust CSDMS cybertools will bring predictive modeling to a new level of sophistication. By easing the process of model-data coupling, CSDMS aids innovation in the science of Earth-surface processes by allowing the community to simulate landscape response to changes in climate or natural hazards, as well as to policy-driven land-use or engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The southern section of the SAF has not produced a major earthquake in historic times (over the last 300 years), and is currently believed to pose the largest seismic risk in California. This project will use new seismic and geodetic observations to investigate the sub-surface structure and geometry of the Southern San Andreas Fault (SSAF). In particular, the project will test a hypothesis that the SSAF may not be vertical and may substantial dip to the East. If confirmed, a non-vertical fault dip would have important implications for the mechanics and the long-term tectonic evolution of the SSAF. Better knowledge of the sub-surface geometry of the SSAF will also improve  predictions of seismic radiation patterns and the intensity of ground shaking due to future large earthquakes on the SSAF. The broader impacts of this work will be refined estimates of seismic hazard in densely populated areas in Southern California and Mexico as well as support for the education of two graduate students.<br/><br/>The researchers from this joint project between the University of California San Diego, Scripps Institution of Oceanography and the University of Southern California, will investigate the fault attitude at depth by imaging a low-rigidity damage zone and/or a bi-material interface associated with the SSAF in the upper crust. This will be accomplished by deploying a dense seismic array spanning the SSAF. Data from the deployed seismic array and regional seismic networks will be used to generate high-resolution tomographic images of the fault zone throughout the seismogenic layer. Seismic data will be combined with high-resolution geodetic observations, including Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). A joint analysis of seismic and geodetic data will provide new insights into the spatial extent and degree of damage around a mature plate boundary fault and enable comparisons with observations from other faults in California and elsewhere to examine how the distribution and amount of damage might depend on the fault age, seismic potential, and geometric complexity. The deployment of co-located dense seismic and geodetic arrays will establish a baseline for future measurements of possible time-dependent variations in mechanical properties of rocks comprising the fault zone due to external stress perturbations, which may help constrain the magnitude of absolute stress at seismogenic depth.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Important characteristics of the Critical Zone are buried within it: how does the ground beneath our feet vary, how has it developed over time, and, how can we predict changes that may occur across time and space. Addressing these questions will affect how we manage the projected increase in demand for food, energy, and water that will accompany the growth in human population to 9 billion people by 2050. This project is a Research Coordination Network (RCN) that will bring together scientific expertise and students to explore these topics.<br/><br/>This research coordination network (RCN) is intended to synthesize data and models to investigate a key research question: How has the structure of the Critical Zone evolved in the past and how will it respond to future perturbations resulting from increasingly intensive human activities? Quantifying the depth of Critical-Zone processes is important because it connects multiple areas of investigation: water storage, weathering, biogeochemical fluxes, and societal needs.  Coupling models to data is difficult, since different research domains define the Critical Zone by changes in conditions that are hard to reconcile. Quantifying the gradient in properties that may define the lower boundary of the Critical Zone requires an injection of new ideas, methods, and people from across disciplines. This RCN is built around the following four topics: 1) synthesis efforts that help guide the coming decade of research on Critical-Zone architecture; 2) exploration of a diverse set of complimentary approaches for identifying the lower boundary of the Critical Zone and its influence on processes; 3) training of scientists in multidisciplinary data collection and modeling approaches; and 4) pathways to develop the next generation of Critical-Zone models. This RCN will involve at least 100 scientists, including early-career faculty, postdoctoral associates, and graduate students.  Participants will be recruited from underrepresented ethnic, socio-economic, ability, and sexual identity groups.

These interactions provide societal benefits, including life-sustaining resources, primary among them food and water. Processes in the Critical Zone operate over wide range of time scales that depend, in part, on the composition of the underlying bedrock. Silicate minerals that break down slowly comprise much of the bedrock, but carbonate minerals in limestone tend to react quickly, commonly leaving large voids that facilitate the transfer of water through the Critical Zone. The current Critical Zone Observatory (CZO) network lacks a site that contains significant amounts of carbonate bedrock.  This Research Coordination Network will foster discussion among researchers about Critical Zones with elevated carbonate mineral contents, evaluate how properties and processes of carbonate-rich Critical Zones can be generalized to other lithologies, and integrate these findings with results from the CZO network.<br/><br/>A principal goal of this project is to create a Research Coordination Network (RCN) in which researchers can evaluate Critical-Zone properties and processes that are endemic to Critical Zones in carbonate terrains.  A related and equally important goal is to integrate new findings with on-going research within the CZO network.  These goals will be achieved through four primary technical objectives: (1) compile available data and models stemming from current research ;(2) convene workshops, in the field and at major disciplinary conferences to explore new research directions; (3) build capacity in state- of-the-art techniques used to study carbonate Critical Zones;  (4) use data compilation, workshop participation, and training to advance knowledge of properties and processes in all Critical-Zone environments.  Outcomes of these objectives will include expanding knowledge of how relative amounts of carbonate and silicate minerals may cause different properties and processes in the Critical Zone between regions.  This Research Coordination Network will also develop human capital of Critical-Zone science by including underrepresented groups in all project activities and by research collaborations created during workshops.

Rocks ?weather? (chemically change) from the bottom up over long periods, influencing groundwater and stream chemistry. Stream chemistry is critical for freshwater habitat and drinking water quality. In urban areas, human activities alter this geologic foundation, moving earth for construction, burying water and sewer pipes, and applying road salt and fertilizer. Little is known about how above-ground urban processes and below-ground geological processes interact to change weathering and chemistry of groundwater and streams. This project studies the interactions of natural and anthropogenic weathering processes and their effects on water quality, using a cluster of four cities as our laboratory -- Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, DC, and Raleigh. The cities are located along the Fall Zone - a geologic transition that creates waterfalls, along the Eastern Seaboard.  The cities capture variation in climate, development age, and population density. Research methods include observational and modeling activities that integrated multiple processes in urban Critical Zones. This project will train 7 undergraduates per year, 7 graduate students, and 1 post-doctoral associate. Project participants will work with K-12 teachers to integrate Critical Zone science in the classroom and provide professional development. A regional Critical Zone Citizen Science Interest Group will be convened to adopt project protocols in local programs and contribute to project research. An engagement plan to foster interaction with a broad community of other Critical Zone scientists includes hosting open quarterly science meetings and establishing a visiting scholar fund. Project results will allow policy makers and regulators to incorporate Critical Zone processes into management of water quality and resilient, sustainable, urban development. <br/><br/>This project will advance knowledge of urban critical zone processes through a Critical Zone (CZ) Cluster spanning four cities on the U.S. East Coast: Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, DC, and Raleigh. These cities were developed along the Fall Zone, a region of steep rivers incised into crystalline Piedmont bedrock upstream of the Atlantic Coastal Plain. The north-south gradient of this urban cluster is associated with climatic trends and with a gradient in age from older and denser development in Philadelphia and Baltimore to newer and sparser development in Raleigh. The project will address the following research questions: (1) How does urbanization in a temperate, Eastern seaboard landscape result in a shift from a supply-limited to a transport-limited regime governing solute export?; (2) How does the underlying structure of the CZ along the Piedmont-Coastal Plain transition interact with urbanization to affect export fluxes?; and (3) How do chemical and hydrological dynamics associated with urbanization affect material export along the latitudinal gradient from Philadelphia to Raleigh? Research methods will include development of a watershed-scale geochemical-hydrological model as a framework for data collection, assimilation, and prediction; geophysics for subsurface mapping; land cover/land use data analysis; soil and rock core chemical analysis; soil gas sampling; stream and well sampling for solutes; and analysis of sediment concentrations and yields. A new conceptual model of solute movement from the land surface through the subsurface to streams, constrained by geologic and geomorphic architecture and the overprinting of urban development will be developed. This project will train 7 undergraduates per year, 7 graduate students, and 1 post-doctoral associate. Existing institutional programs will be utilized to recruit underrepresented groups into STEM fields for the project. Project participants will work with high school science teachers to identify topics for a CZ instructional module and a teacher professional development program.

They are an integral part of the Critical Zone that regulates the conditions at the Earth?s surface and helps sustain life. Coastal marshes provide crucial services such as carbon storage and removal of nutrients and contaminants that would otherwise make their way to the ocean.  Rising sea level is expanding these environments, but salt-water is also moving in, destroying woodlands, and damaging farm fields. Ghost forests and salt-damaged farm fields are stark indicators of these ecological changes along world coastlines that can adversely affect land use and economies. Less apparent, and perhaps even more important, are the concurrent changes in water and chemical cycling that are altering the functioning of the coastal Critical Zone. This research project will quantify the processes that occur in the changing coastal Critical Zone and associated alterations in cycling, fluxes, and storage of elements at the land-sea margin. The project will address important questions about how sea-level rise may alter the natural ?plumbing? that occurs at the land-sea boundary and its implications with respect to coastal ecosystems. The results will assist decision-makers and stakeholders in planning for future environmental changes.  <br/><br/>This project will quantify the coupled processes and feedbacks that govern the hydrological, ecological, geomorphological, and biogeochemical transformations in the coastal Critical Zone and how rising sea level will translate to changes in cycling, fluxes, and storage of elements at the land-sea margin. Sea-level rise pushes salt and inundation fronts inland via storms and tides (fast processes) while gradually elevating the water table (slow processes). The complexity of the system, with its strong hydrologic transience (e.g. tides, storms), tightly coupled ecosystem and biogeochemical mosaics, and human influences, make functioning and response at the marsh-upland transition difficult to characterize and predict. The governing hypotheses of this project address (1) the major fast and slow hydrological drivers of coastal Critical-Zone transition, (2) the landscape feedbacks in which ecological change drives geomorphological evolution that feeds back into hydrological and biogeochemical processes, and (3) biogeochemical feedbacks in which salinization and redox shifts alter cycling, mobility, and sequestration of nutrients and carbon. These processes differ between areas where the marsh abuts forested uplands versus agricultural land. The hypotheses will be addressed through interdisciplinary field observations, experiments, and modeling that are fully integrated across three locations along the mid-Atlantic coast with paired marsh-forest and marsh-agriculture sites. The forested and agricultural sites at each location represent major differences in hydrology, geochemistry, and ecology, and are expected to respond differently to rising sea level. This project addresses pressing needs to determine how landscapes in the coastal Critical Zone may respond to sea-level rise and how Critical-Zone research can be applied to developing policies and actions to mitigate the effects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This Critical Zone provides crucial services to humans and ecosystems, including the storage and filtering of groundwater, maintenance of streamflow, and long-term regulation of Earth?s climate. This project, part of the Critical Zone Collaborative Network,  will establish the Bedrock Critical Zone Network that spans a wide range of climatic conditions across the continental US, ranging from a subtropical site in the South Carolina Piedmont to warm and dry sites in southern California. The principal goal is to improve knowledge of how subsurface processes in the deep Critical Zone influence water storage potential. In addition, the project will explore how water storage affects ecosystem resilience to disturbances such as prolonged drought. The research will involve direct sampling of subsurface materials via drilling and borehole logging together with non-invasive, indirect imaging techniques. The project will engage teachers, students, and the broader public in information sessions that emphasize the crucial importance of the Critical Zone, including development of a set of interactive 3D visualizations for use by educators.<br/><br/>The Critical Zone extends from treetop to bedrock and thus includes both the substrate for life and the organisms that live at Earth?s land surface. In hilly and mountainous landscapes, where erosion at the surface exhumes underlying bedrock, the deepest reaches of the Critical Zone are where bedrock begins the weathering process, where fluids and gases first penetrate and react, where biota begin to colonize and interact with minerals, and where pore space begins to open. This project establishes the Bedrock Critical Zone Network to provide the scientific community with new knowledge of the deep Critical Zone and its feedbacks with surface processes and ecosystems. Observations and modeling at seven sites spanning a wide range of climatic and bedrock conditions in the continental US will test the hypothesis that Critical Zone structure, evolution, and processes are strongly influenced by bedrock conditions at the base of the Critical Zone.  Mineralogy, ambient stress, and inherited fractures are influential factors, and these, in turn, are influenced by surface processes like erosion, subsurface flow, and ecosystem productivity. The project will address questions about fundamental deep Critical Zone properties and processes, including: controls on regolith thickness and its variation across landscapes; the relative importance and spatial variability of physical and chemical weathering; how subsurface weathering influences landscape evolution; and how deep Critical Zone  water storage affects ecosystem resilience.The project will engage teachers, students, and the broader public on the crucial importance of the Critical Zone ; train scientists at diverse career stages on how to communicate; and promote diversity, inclusion, and equity in Critical-Zone science through targeted programs. The project will undertake an outreach and engagement program that includes a new set of interactive 3D visualizations, called the ""Virtual Critical Zone,"" based on extensive imaging and measurements of roadcuts and quarries.

The Critical Zone can absorb many disturbances while still supporting life on Earth, but the age of humans or the ?Anthropocene? has put unprecedented pressure on the Critical Zone. When long-term disturbances like climate change are combined with short-term disturbances like fires or flooding, ecosystems can be pushed past a breaking point where important ecosystem services shut down. This project seeks to understand and predict Critical Zone resilience in the face of multiple natural and human disturbances. The research will combine river flow and chemistry data from throughout the U.S. to shed light on how quickly ecosystems recover from local disturbances and to what degree long-term change is altering the structure of the Critical Zone. The team of researchers will combine ecological approaches with data science methods to analyze large quantities of information from thousands of locations. Existing data from public and private organizations across the U.S. will be compiled into a publicly available data base to compare ecosystem recovery times and trajectories. The general patterns observed in the ?big data? analysis will be tested by in-depth field studies at four sites experiencing multiple disturbances such as wildfire, acidification, and extreme storms.  This project will help Earth science researchers and educators across the U.S. develop a deeper understanding of how the Earth system maintains itself and how humans can avoid eroding the ecosystem services that sustain us. To achieve this goal, all data and approaches will be shared publicly and the research team will lead an innovative outreach and education program. This comprehensive program will educate 7-12 grade teachers to bring cutting-edge ecology and data science to schools across America. To enhance diversity in Earth science and data science, a field camp will be co-designed and implemented in collaboration with historically black colleges and universities. <br/><br/>While observatory-based Critical Zone research produces important findings on catchment-scale processes, the global scale of disturbance in the Anthropocene transcends the bounds of a single site or funding cycle, posing a challenge for traditional investigative approaches. This spatial and temporal mismatch significantly limits the predictive power of individual site studies in the context of regional- to continental-scale environmental change. To advance network-scale syntheses and integrate across scales, this project will apply an iterative ?pattern to process? and ?process to pattern? approach to investigate how Critical Zone structure controls water, carbon, nutrients, and response to overlapping disturbances in the context of multi-dimensional resilience. In this context, the  overarching hypothesis is that Critical Zone structure (i.e. configuration of biological, chemical, and physical characteristics) controls the timing, direction, and intensity of linkages among multiple responses and that these linkages regulate ecosystem resilience and resistance to climate and land cover disturbance. To test this overarching hypothesis, (1) existing ecohydrological data will be compiled from across the continental U.S. into a multi-dimensional Critical Zone database, (2) advanced statistical analysis will be performed using complex-systems tools on ?big data? to identify state changes in ecological function and ecosystem services, (3) process-hypotheses will be refined based on these data-driven approaches, and (4) in-depth process investigations will be performed at four high-vulnerability focal sites in the northeast and southwest. The database and complex-systems approaches will be shared to empower the Critical Zone community to transition into a phase of data-driven hypothesis generation and cross-site research. To broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in Critical Zone and data science the project will educate and empower a diverse new generation of STEM thinkers from middle and high school to the graduate college level. A comprehensive grade 7-12 education program will reach hundreds of students from high-need Vermont schools (historically marginalized economic, racial or disability groupings) by ?educating the educators? in Critical Zone and data science.

The Critical Zone can absorb many disturbances while still supporting life on Earth, but the age of humans or the ?Anthropocene? has put unprecedented pressure on the Critical Zone. When long-term disturbances like climate change are combined with short-term disturbances like fires or flooding, ecosystems can be pushed past a breaking point where important ecosystem services shut down. This project seeks to understand and predict Critical Zone resilience in the face of multiple natural and human disturbances. The research will combine river flow and chemistry data from throughout the U.S. to shed light on how quickly ecosystems recover from local disturbances and to what degree long-term change is altering the structure of the Critical Zone. The team of researchers will combine ecological approaches with data science methods to analyze large quantities of information from thousands of locations. Existing data from public and private organizations across the U.S. will be compiled into a publicly available data base to compare ecosystem recovery times and trajectories. The general patterns observed in the ?big data? analysis will be tested by in-depth field studies at four sites experiencing multiple disturbances such as wildfire, acidification, and extreme storms.  This project will help Earth science researchers and educators across the U.S. develop a deeper understanding of how the Earth system maintains itself and how humans can avoid eroding the ecosystem services that sustain us. To achieve this goal, all data and approaches will be shared publicly and the research team will lead an innovative outreach and education program.

The critical zone supports life on Earth. In the western United States, the critical zone is sensitive to changes in the environment, such as fires or droughts.  This project studies how processes in the critical zone respond to changes in the environment. Data are collected from five watersheds in Colorado and California. The project links the fields of water science, forest ecology, rock chemistry and soil chemistry. The project connects the way water moves and is stored in the ground to how trees grow and to how soil and rocks change. Studying these interactions is important to understanding how Earth will respond to future changes in climate. Researchers from six universities work together. Students are trained in several areas of Earth science. Educational materials are developed for all grade levels including K-12 and college. <br/><br/>The Earth?s critical zone is defined as the upper layer of the Earth?s surface, from bedrock to the tree canopy, and is dependent upon the co-evolution of Earth system processes including interactions among climate, hydrology, biogeochemistry, and geology. Despite the fundamental importance of water in critical zone processes, there is not widespread understanding of the relations between how water is stored in the critical zone and how it affects key processes, or how global change drivers, such as climate shifts and disturbance, will modify these interactions. The goals of this critical zone network cluster are to 1) advance understanding of the interactions among water storage, critical zone processes, and water provisioning in the complex physiography of western United States montane ecosystems; 2) explore how water storage and critical zone processes will be altered under global change drivers; and 3) create educational opportunities and resources about the critical zone that are accessible to a diverse student population, including K-12 to postgraduates. The network cluster consists of five research catchments with differing critical zone structure and water storage capacity where the research team collects a common suite of field measurements and conducts coordinated modeling activities. Field measurements include monitoring of hydrologic and biogeochemical fluxes, as well as, surveys of near-surface geophysical properties and forest structure and dynamics. The modeling platforms for this project include: 1) integrated hydrologic models that can fully resolve overland, unsaturated, and saturated flow to full quantify the roles of climate, vegetation, subsurface structure, and topography on hydrologic partitioning, 2) reactive transport models that fully resolve biogeochemical reaction networks with flexible implementation of reaction kinetics and thermodynamics to estimate weathering and biogeochemical reaction rates and fluxes at the catchment scale, and 3) an ecohydrology model that couples hydrologic processes with dynamics of vegetation and ecosystem carbon and nutrient cycles and ecosystem disturbance including vegetation mortality and fire. The broader impacts of this project include 1) research experiences and training of students at multiple education levels, including students in middle school, undergraduate institutions, and graduate school; and 2) improving public science literacy of critical zone processes through the creation of interactive virtual reality video installations. In addition, this network cluster maintains and expands research infrastructure to provide a facility for the Earth science community.

For urban areas, the built environment is an integral but understudied part of the Critical Zone. Soil and rock influence the chemistry of groundwater flowing through the subsurface to streams. Rocks ?weather? (chemically change) from the bottom up over long periods, influencing groundwater and stream chemistry. Stream chemistry is critical for freshwater habitat and drinking water quality. In urban areas, human activities alter this geologic foundation, moving earth for construction, burying water and sewer pipes, and applying road salt and fertilizer. Little is known about how above-ground urban processes and below-ground geological processes interact to change weathering and chemistry of groundwater and streams. This project studies the interactions of natural and anthropogenic weathering processes and their effects on water quality, using a cluster of four cities as our laboratory -- Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, DC, and Raleigh. The cities are located along the Fall Zone - a geologic transition that creates waterfalls, along the Eastern Seaboard.  The cities capture variation in climate, development age, and population density. Research methods include observational and modeling activities that integrated multiple processes in urban Critical Zones. This project will train 7 undergraduates per year, 7 graduate students, and 1 post-doctoral associate. Project participants will work with K-12 teachers to integrate Critical Zone science in the classroom and provide professional development. A regional Critical Zone Citizen Science Interest Group will be convened to adopt project protocols in local programs and contribute to project research. An engagement plan to foster interaction with a broad community of other Critical Zone scientists includes hosting open quarterly science meetings and establishing a visiting scholar fund. Project results will allow policy makers and regulators to incorporate Critical Zone processes into management of water quality and resilient, sustainable, urban development. <br/><br/>This project will advance knowledge of urban critical zone processes through a Critical Zone (CZ) Cluster spanning four cities on the U.S. East Coast: Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, DC, and Raleigh. These cities were developed along the Fall Zone, a region of steep rivers incised into crystalline Piedmont bedrock upstream of the Atlantic Coastal Plain. The north-south gradient of this urban cluster is associated with climatic trends and with a gradient in age from older and denser development in Philadelphia and Baltimore to newer and sparser development in Raleigh. The project will address the following research questions: (1) How does urbanization in a temperate, Eastern seaboard landscape result in a shift from a supply-limited to a transport-limited regime governing solute export?; (2) How does the underlying structure of the CZ along the Piedmont-Coastal Plain transition interact with urbanization to affect export fluxes?; and (3) How do chemical and hydrological dynamics associated with urbanization affect material export along the latitudinal gradient from Philadelphia to Raleigh? Research methods will include development of a watershed-scale geochemical-hydrological model as a framework for data collection, assimilation, and prediction; geophysics for subsurface mapping; land cover/land use data analysis; soil and rock core chemical analysis; soil gas sampling; stream and well sampling for solutes; and analysis of sediment concentrations and yields. A new conceptual model of solute movement from the land surface through the subsurface to streams, constrained by geologic and geomorphic architecture and the overprinting of urban development will be developed. This project will train 7 undergraduates per year, 7 graduate students, and 1 post-doctoral associate. Existing institutional programs will be utilized to recruit underrepresented groups into STEM fields for the project. Project participants will work with high school science teachers to identify topics for a CZ instructional module and a teacher professional development program.

Critical Zone science is at an important juncture: it is incorporating life in more quantitative ways. This project will evaluate the contribution of the microorganisms that drive so many of the dynamics of the Critical Zone, addressing crucial gaps in our knowledge of surface and deep soil microbes and their functions. The major goal of this research is to develop a predictive understanding of the role of microbes as drivers of Critical Zone biogeochemistry and soil formation. The researchers? preliminary investigations across the former Critical Zone Observatory Network identified variable patterns in microbial biodiversity with increasing soil depth across sites, with some sites showing little to no change with depth, and others a complete turnover of the microbial community members. The current project will illuminate the mechanisms underlying these trends. This project will train numerous undergraduate students, most of whom will be underrepresented minorities at several Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs) and high schools in underserved communities across California. Results will be disseminated to the greater public through a series of webinars that will provide real life examples of how to address Critical Zone science questions by leveraging diverse scientific backgrounds, as well as through incorporation into the ?Welcome to the Critical Zone? public museum exhibit at The University of Arizona?s Flandrau Science Center.<br/><br/>This project will address the hypothesis that soil type, hydrology, and lithology are key determinants of the depth to which surface influences such as vegetation and climate drive microbial community composition, diversity, and activity. Specifically, where soils are deep or are derived from nutrient- rich bedrock, the researchers hypothesize that rooting depths will be greater, resulting in a greater similarity between surface and deep soil microbial communities compared to those from shallower soils or those developed from less nutrient-rich substrates. In this proposed project, the researchers will use a novel combination of DNA and RNA sequencing, real-time soil gas and environmental monitoring, quantified enzyme activities, detailed soil organic matter and isotopic analyses, as well as root abundances to address the hypothesis. To amplify the impact of this approach, the project will develop a unique and detailed geomicrobiology characterization of key indicator species of bacteria, archaea and fungi, grouped to distinguish those that are surface-based and those representative of bedrock interactions. This novel framework will be tested across years and will generate a resource for the larger NSF Geoscience community for years to come.

Rocks, soil, water, air, and living organisms interact in the Critical Zone to provide life-sustaining resources such as food and water. Drylands, with arid to semi-arid climates, cover 45% of the Earth and provide homes to more than 2 billion people. The drylands of the American West are facing significant challenges caused by global change, such as drought and changing plant communities. Increases in human population and food demand have also converted many natural drylands in this region to irrigated farms. These changes in land use and climate have greatly affected the movement of water, carbon, nutrients and salt through different parts of the drylands. All of these changes impact the sustainability of natural and agricultural ecosystems. This project will investigate these important Critical Zone processes and improve our ability to predict future change. Specifically, this thematic cluster will investigate how carbonate minerals in dryland soils control and impact water, nutrients, salts, and carbon moving in and out of the Critical Zone. This project will help to educate and train middle to high school students, and college undergraduate and graduate students. These students will be provided with the motivation, skills and tools to become future professionals in science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM). Our research and education efforts will also help to grow public awareness of the importance of the Critical Zone function and service in drylands.<br/><br/>The Critical Zone in dryland ecosystems is an understudied but crucial part of the Earth system. It contrasts with mesic areas by having sparse vegetation, limited but dynamic soil moisture, deep water table, low soil organic matter, alkaline pH, and buildup of salt precipitates, especially as pedogenic carbonates that can develop into a thick caliche layer and dominate the soil structure. However, these systems are underrepresented in Critical Zone research and current conceptual models do not fully address phenomena unique to drylands such as development of pedogenic carbonate, dust storms, episodic precipitation, and high spatiotemporal variability in hydrological and biogeochemical processes. To fill these knowledge gaps, the overarching goal of the project is to increase our capacity to quantify and predict dryland carbon budgets across land-use and climatic gradients by examining the role of water and nutrient availability in regulating the movement of organic and inorganic carbon in the dryland Critical Zone. Specifically, this project centers around the multifaceted roles of pedogenic carbonates in dictating vadose zone water dynamics, the potential recharge to deep water table, and nutrient cycling in typical dryland landscapes, piedmont, playa and irrigated agricultural fields. These in turn drive trends in evolution of Critical Zone architectures and land-atmosphere C exchange. We will tackle these problems by using a comprehensive set of tools including eddy covariance towers, deep Critical Zone drilling, hydrogeophysical surveys, soil and hydrologic sensors, isotopic analysis, synchrotron, geochemical proxies, and genetic sequencing. This project builds on the rich historical data, knowledge, and models at the Jornada LTER, the Reynolds Creek CZO, USDA-ARS Kimberly site in Idaho and irrigated agricultural sites along the Rio Grande Valley in Texas. This thematic cluster will develop an interdisciplinary framework to understand material and energy flow through dryland Critical Zones and lay the foundation for managing Critical Zone function, evolution, and services, as well as forecasting carbon budget changes with future shifts in climate and land use in drylands.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Critical Zone Collaborative Network and the Hydrologic Sciences programs in the Division of Earth Sciences and the Hispanic Serving Institutions program in the Education and Human Resources Directorate's Division of Human Resource Development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Rising sea level is expanding these environments, but salt-water is also moving in, destroying woodlands, and damaging farm fields. Ghost forests and salt-damaged farm fields are stark indicators of these ecological changes along world coastlines that can adversely affect land use and economies. Less apparent, and perhaps even more important, are the concurrent changes in water and chemical cycling that are altering the functioning of the coastal Critical Zone. This research project will quantify the processes that occur in the changing coastal Critical Zone and associated alterations in cycling, fluxes, and storage of elements at the land-sea margin.

The complexity of the system, with its strong hydrologic transience (e.g. tides, storms), tightly coupled ecosystem and biogeochemical mosaics, and human influences, make functioning and response at the marsh-upland transition difficult to characterize and predict. The governing hypotheses of this project address (1) the major fast and slow hydrological drivers of coastal Critical-Zone transition, (2) the landscape feedbacks in which ecological change drives geomorphological evolution that feeds back into hydrological and biogeochemical processes, and (3) biogeochemical feedbacks in which salinization and redox shifts alter cycling, mobility, and sequestration of nutrients and carbon. These processes differ between areas where the marsh abuts forested uplands versus agricultural land. The hypotheses will be addressed through interdisciplinary field observations, experiments, and modeling that are fully integrated across three locations along the mid-Atlantic coast with paired marsh-forest and marsh-agriculture sites. The forested and agricultural sites at each location represent major differences in hydrology, geochemistry, and ecology, and are expected to respond differently to rising sea level.

For urban areas, the built environment is an integral but understudied part of the Critical Zone. Soil and rock influence the chemistry of groundwater flowing through the subsurface to streams. Rocks ?weather? (chemically change) from the bottom up over long periods, influencing groundwater and stream chemistry. Stream chemistry is critical for freshwater habitat and drinking water quality. In urban areas, human activities alter this geologic foundation, moving earth for construction, burying water and sewer pipes, and applying road salt and fertilizer. Little is known about how above-ground urban processes and below-ground geological processes interact to change weathering and chemistry of groundwater and streams. This project studies the interactions of natural and anthropogenic weathering processes and their effects on water quality, using a cluster of four cities as our laboratory -- Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, DC, and Raleigh. The cities are located along the Fall Zone - a geologic transition that creates waterfalls, along the Eastern Seaboard.  The cities capture variation in climate, development age, and population density. Research methods include observational and modeling activities that integrated multiple processes in urban Critical Zones. This project will train 7 undergraduates per year, 7 graduate students, and 1 post-doctoral associate. Project participants will work with K-12 teachers to integrate Critical Zone science in the classroom and provide professional development. A regional Critical Zone Citizen Science Interest Group will be convened to adopt project protocols in local programs and contribute to project research. An engagement plan to foster interaction with a broad community of other Critical Zone scientists includes hosting open quarterly science meetings and establishing a visiting scholar fund. Project results will allow policy makers and regulators to incorporate Critical Zone processes into management of water quality and resilient, sustainable, urban development. <br/><br/>This project will advance knowledge of urban critical zone processes through a Critical Zone (CZ) Cluster spanning four cities on the U.S. East Coast: Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, DC, and Raleigh. These cities were developed along the Fall Zone, a region of steep rivers incised into crystalline Piedmont bedrock upstream of the Atlantic Coastal Plain. The north-south gradient of this urban cluster is associated with climatic trends and with a gradient in age from older and denser development in Philadelphia and Baltimore to newer and sparser development in Raleigh. The project will address the following research questions: (1) How does urbanization in a temperate, Eastern seaboard landscape result in a shift from a supply-limited to a transport-limited regime governing solute export?; (2) How does the underlying structure of the CZ along the Piedmont-Coastal Plain transition interact with urbanization to affect export fluxes?; and (3) How do chemical and hydrological dynamics associated with urbanization affect material export along the latitudinal gradient from Philadelphia to Raleigh? Research methods will include development of a watershed-scale geochemical-hydrological model as a framework for data collection, assimilation, and prediction; geophysics for subsurface mapping; land cover/land use data analysis; soil and rock core chemical analysis; soil gas sampling; stream and well sampling for solutes; and analysis of sediment concentrations and yields. A new conceptual model of solute movement from the land surface through the subsurface to streams, constrained by geologic and geomorphic architecture and the overprinting of urban development will be developed. This project will train 7 undergraduates per year, 7 graduate students, and 1 post-doctoral associate. Existing institutional programs will be utilized to recruit underrepresented groups into STEM fields for the project. Project participants will work with high school science teachers to identify topics for a CZ instructional module and a teacher professional development program. A regional CZ Citizen Science Interest Group will be convened to identify opportunities to adopt CZ project protocols in local programs and to contribute to CZ project research.

Critical Zone science is at an important juncture: it is incorporating life in more quantitative ways. This project will evaluate the contribution of the microorganisms that drive so many of the dynamics of the Critical Zone, addressing crucial gaps in our knowledge of surface and deep soil microbes and their functions. The major goal of this research is to develop a predictive understanding of the role of microbes as drivers of Critical Zone biogeochemistry and soil formation. The researchers? preliminary investigations across the former Critical Zone Observatory Network identified variable patterns in microbial biodiversity with increasing soil depth across sites, with some sites showing little to no change with depth, and others a complete turnover of the microbial community members. The current project will illuminate the mechanisms underlying these trends. This project will train numerous undergraduate students, most of whom will be underrepresented minorities at several Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs) and high schools in underserved communities across California. Results will be disseminated to the greater public through a series of webinars that will provide real life examples of how to address Critical Zone science questions by leveraging diverse scientific backgrounds, as well as through incorporation into the ?Welcome to the Critical Zone? public museum exhibit at The University of Arizona?s Flandrau Science Center.<br/><br/>This project will address the hypothesis that soil type, hydrology, and lithology are key determinants of the depth to which surface influences such as vegetation and climate drive microbial community composition, diversity, and activity. Specifically, where soils are deep or are derived from nutrient- rich bedrock, the researchers hypothesize that rooting depths will be greater, resulting in a greater similarity between surface and deep soil microbial communities compared to those from shallower soils or those developed from less nutrient-rich substrates. In this proposed project, the researchers will use a novel combination of DNA and RNA sequencing, real-time soil gas and environmental monitoring, quantified enzyme activities, detailed soil organic matter and isotopic analyses, as well as root abundances to address the hypothesis. To amplify the impact of this approach, the project will develop a unique and detailed geomicrobiology characterization of key indicator species of bacteria, archaea and fungi, grouped to distinguish those that are surface-based and those representative of bedrock interactions. This novel framework will be tested across years and will generate a resource for the larger NSF Geoscience community for years to come.

Studying these interactions is important to understanding how Earth will respond to future changes in climate. Researchers from six universities work together. Students are trained in several areas of Earth science. Educational materials are developed for all grade levels including K-12 and college. <br/><br/>The Earth?s critical zone is defined as the upper layer of the Earth?s surface, from bedrock to the tree canopy, and is dependent upon the co-evolution of Earth system processes including interactions among climate, hydrology, biogeochemistry, and geology. Despite the fundamental importance of water in critical zone processes, there is not widespread understanding of the relations between how water is stored in the critical zone and how it affects key processes, or how global change drivers, such as climate shifts and disturbance, will modify these interactions. The goals of this critical zone network cluster are to 1) advance understanding of the interactions among water storage, critical zone processes, and water provisioning in the complex physiography of western United States montane ecosystems; 2) explore how water storage and critical zone processes will be altered under global change drivers; and 3) create educational opportunities and resources about the critical zone that are accessible to a diverse student population, including K-12 to postgraduates. The network cluster consists of five research catchments with differing critical zone structure and water storage capacity where the research team collects a common suite of field measurements and conducts coordinated modeling activities. Field measurements include monitoring of hydrologic and biogeochemical fluxes, as well as, surveys of near-surface geophysical properties and forest structure and dynamics. The modeling platforms for this project include: 1) integrated hydrologic models that can fully resolve overland, unsaturated, and saturated flow to full quantify the roles of climate, vegetation, subsurface structure, and topography on hydrologic partitioning, 2) reactive transport models that fully resolve biogeochemical reaction networks with flexible implementation of reaction kinetics and thermodynamics to estimate weathering and biogeochemical reaction rates and fluxes at the catchment scale, and 3) an ecohydrology model that couples hydrologic processes with dynamics of vegetation and ecosystem carbon and nutrient cycles and ecosystem disturbance including vegetation mortality and fire. The broader impacts of this project include 1) research experiences and training of students at multiple education levels, including students in middle school, undergraduate institutions, and graduate school; and 2) improving public science literacy of critical zone processes through the creation of interactive virtual reality video installations. In addition, this network cluster maintains and expands research infrastructure to provide a facility for the Earth science community.  This project is jointly funded by the Critical Zone Collaborative Network, the Hydrologic Sciences, and the Education and Human Resources programs in the Division of Earth Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the US Midwest, intensive management includes frequent working of the soil through tillage, widespread application of fertilizers, and efforts to improve the flow of water off of flat, poorly drained fields by installing pipes within the soil and by enlarging streams. Although these activities enhance crop production, over time they induce changes that can degrade the environmental quality of soil and water, not only locally but far downstream.  Sustaining agricultural production while protecting environmental quality depends on an understanding of how natural processes are linked with intensive landscape management.   This project seeks to advance understanding of important elements that act as ?Critical Interfaces? and play important roles in regulating hydrological, biological, ecological, geological, and chemical processes on which agricultural production and environmental quality depend.  Important critical interfaces examined in the project include the soil surface, the root zone in the soil, and river corridors. The project examines the extent to which these critical interfaces are interconnected and control the response of the environment. Using a network of observational sites across the US Midwest having different climates, topography, geologic history, and other landscape attributes, this project will provide a comprehensive understanding of how various components of intensively managed landscapes function together to influence, and be influenced by, high levels of agricultural production. The outcomes of this research will provide basic knowledge and new predictive capabilities for developing sustainable and resilient agro-ecosystems.  The project will contribute to society by developing a strong STEM workforce that can tackle multidisciplinary issues, establishing programs to engage community members in critical zone science, communicating results to the public, and facilitating venues for professional development and certifications, and working with citizen groups and stakeholders to communicate findings and gather feedback throughout the course of the project.<br/><br/>Critical zone dynamics in intensively managed landscapes (IMLs) do not operate uniformly over time and space. They are intermittent and concentrated at critical interfaces (CIs) of exceptional importance for regulating material (i.e., water, sediment, carbon and nutrients) storage, transport and transformations. The central hypothesis of this research is that the dynamics of critical interfaces exert disproportionately large control on the overall dynamics of critical zones at the landscape scale; and since these critical interfaces are undergoing rapid and co-evolutionary transition due to human and weather stressors across spatial and temporal scales, they constitute the most limiting elements for predictive understanding to guide sustainable management of IMLs.  Using a network of observational sites across key environmental gradients, with novel data analytic and integrated modeling approaches, this project will advance understanding of critical interfaces individually as well as their interdependencies to overcome predictability bottlenecks of hydrobiogeochemical phenomena and their trajectories in IMLs from the small scale to the landscape scale, and from the event time scale to seasonal, inter-annual and decadal time scales. The study focuses on three interfaces that are strongly influenced by human action: the near-land surface, the active root zone, and the stream corridor. The project leverages existing infrastructure and knowledge from a network of sites in the glaciated parts of US Midwest and outer reaches of the upper Mississippi River basin, as well as critical zone international networks. The sites, which include CZOs, LTARs and the Great Rivers Ecological Observation Network, incorporate a wide range of geologic, weather, soil, land use and geomorphologic gradients. Synthesis of this work will offer new predictive capability to earthcast critical zone dynamics across the globe to advance convergent research of the human influence on life-sustaining resources and improve our ability to significantly reduce predictive uncertainty and advance environmental sustainability goals. In collaboration with the National Great Rivers Research and Education Center, a program of Lewis and Clark Community College in Godfrey, Illinois, the project will further provide training and education for postdoctoral associates, undergraduate and graduate students, community-college students, and high-school teachers, while engaging stakeholders and members of the broader communities. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Critical Zone Collaborative Network, Geobiology and Low-Temperature Geochemistry, Hydrologic Sciences, and Geomorphology and Land-Use Dynamics programs in the Division of Earth Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Critical Zone science is at an important juncture: it is incorporating life in more quantitative ways. This project will evaluate the contribution of the microorganisms that drive so many of the dynamics of the Critical Zone, addressing crucial gaps in our knowledge of surface and deep soil microbes and their functions. The major goal of this research is to develop a predictive understanding of the role of microbes as drivers of Critical Zone biogeochemistry and soil formation. The researchers? preliminary investigations across the former Critical Zone Observatory Network identified variable patterns in microbial biodiversity with increasing soil depth across sites, with some sites showing little to no change with depth, and others a complete turnover of the microbial community members. The current project will illuminate the mechanisms underlying these trends. This project will train numerous undergraduate students, most of whom will be underrepresented minorities at several Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs) and high schools in underserved communities across California. Results will be disseminated to the greater public through a series of webinars that will provide real life examples of how to address Critical Zone science questions by leveraging diverse scientific backgrounds, as well as through incorporation into the ?Welcome to the Critical Zone? public museum exhibit at The University of Arizona?s Flandrau Science Center.<br/><br/>This project will address the hypothesis that soil type, hydrology, and lithology are key determinants of the depth to which surface influences such as vegetation and climate drive microbial community composition, diversity, and activity. Specifically, where soils are deep or are derived from nutrient- rich bedrock, the researchers hypothesize that rooting depths will be greater, resulting in a greater similarity between surface and deep soil microbial communities compared to those from shallower soils or those developed from less nutrient-rich substrates. In this proposed project, the researchers will use a novel combination of DNA and RNA sequencing, real-time soil gas and environmental monitoring, quantified enzyme activities, detailed soil organic matter and isotopic analyses, as well as root abundances to address the hypothesis. To amplify the impact of this approach, the project will develop a unique and detailed geomicrobiology characterization of key indicator species of bacteria, archaea and fungi, grouped to distinguish those that are surface-based and those representative of bedrock interactions. This novel framework will be tested across years and will generate a resource for the larger NSF Geoscience community for years to come. This project will also form an important interdisciplinary aspect of the new Critical Zone Collaborative Network, through collaborations with various other Clusters and the Hub.
